Newer engine more reliable, better emissions, better efficiency. Donor engine cheaper than engine rebuild. Experimental builds (lightweight body + high-power engine = superior performance). Fuel availability (diesel fuel supply better than gasoline in region, necessitating gasoline-to-diesel swap).</p><h3>Selection Criteria</h3><p><strong>Power output:</strong> New engine must fit within chassis stress limits. Doubling engine power doubles engine load on frame, suspension, brakes (all must be upgraded). Doubling power typically requires frame reinforcement, upgraded suspension, larger brakes.</p><p><strong>Torque delivery:</strong> High torque at low RPM requires robust transmission. Transmission must handle 150% of original engine torque for durability (accounts for repeated acceleration cycles). Over-revving (continuous high RPM) reduces engine life significantly.</p><p><strong>Engine size & weight:</strong> Engine must fit in engine bay. Weight distribution affects handling (front-heavy = understeer, rear-heavy = oversteer). Aim for 40-60% weight distribution front-to-rear for good handling.</p><h3>Donor Vehicle Selection</h3><p>Same manufacturer simpler (electrical connectors match, mounting points align). Generic mounts can interface engines to different vehicles (e.g., Chevy small-block engine mounts adapt to multiple vehicle types). Cross-platform engines need custom fabrication (mounting brackets, electrical adapters, cooling lines). Cost: $2,000-5,000 for professional engine swap labor plus engine cost ($500-3,000 for used donor).</p></section><section id=compatibility><h2>Engine Compatibility Analysis</h2><h3>Weight & Balance</h3><p>Original curb weight 1500 kg, 60% front (900 kg front axle, 600 kg rear). Swap 200 kg heavier engine from donor: new weight 1700 kg. If heavier engine mounted in same location, front weight = 1100 kg (65%), rear 600 kg (35%). 30% rear weight creates dangerous understeer (vehicle tightens steering, poor stability in turns). Solution: relocate engine rearward (decreases front weight) or add weight to rear (reduces power-to-weight ratio).</p><h3>Transmission & Drivetrain</h3><p>Original transmission rated 200 Nm torque. New engine produces 350 Nm. Transmission overloaded; synchros break, gears strip. Options: (1) Upgrade transmission (expensive). (2) Limit engine power with electronic fuel management. (3) Use engine in lower gear (reduces absolute torque at wheels). Automatic transmissions less sensitive to torque mismatch (fluid coupling absorbs shock).</p><h3>Fuel System Compatibility</h3><p>Original carburetor fuel delivery pressure 2-4 PSI. New fuel injection requires 40-60 PSI. Old mechanical fuel pump insufficient. Upgrade to electric fuel pump (in-tank, 40-60 PSI). Carburetor-to-fuel injection conversion requires computer and sensors.</p><h3>Cooling System Capacity</h3><p>Heat output proportional to power. New high-power engine generates 40-50% more heat. Original radiator inadequate; engine overheats (coolant temp >100°C). Solution: upgrade radiator size (+30% core area). Add electric fan if mechanical fan insufficient. Larger cooling system adds weight and cost ($1,000-2,000).</p></section><section id=mounting><h2>Engine Mounting & Mounts</h2><h3>Mount Points & Stresses</h3><p>Engine connects to frame at 3-4 points typically. Engine produces: (1) Inertial force (accelerating 300 kg mass forward/backward). (2) Torque reaction (crankshaft torque tries to rotate engine in opposite direction of wheels). (3) Vibration (unbalanced rotating components). Mounts must absorb all stresses without allowing engine to contact frame or other components.</p><h3>Mount Types</h3><p><strong>Solid mounts:</strong> Rigid steel or aluminum brackets. Transmit all vibration and noise directly to frame. Cheap but uncomfortable.</p><p><strong>Rubber mounts:</strong> Elastic bushings absorb vibration. Typical stiffness 100-500 N/mm for engine mounts. Softer mounts (lower stiffness) absorb more vibration but allow more engine movement (potential contact with frame at high acceleration). Stiffness selection trades vibration isolation against movement containment.</p><h3>Custom Mount Fabrication</h3><p>Measure engine dimensions and bay dimensions, calculate clearance (minimum 50 mm all directions). Design brackets using 1/4" steel plate (adequate for 400 hp engine). Weld brackets to engine and frame. Drill holes for rubber bushings and bolts. Test fitment before final installation. Cost: $500-1,500 for professional welding and design.</p></section><section id=fuel-systems><h2>Fuel System Adaptation</h2><h3>Fuel Tank Compatibility</h3><p>Original fuel tank adequate capacity but filler neck, sending unit, mounting points differ. Option: (1) Use original tank with custom filler neck adapter. (2) Mount new fuel tank in different location (trunk, under car, rear bumper). Tank location affects weight distribution and crash safety. Fuel tank location change requires custom fuel lines and sending unit adaptation.</p><h3>Fuel Pump Upgrade</h3><p>Mechanical fuel pump (carburetor) delivers 4-6 GPM at 2-4 PSI. Fuel injection requires 10-15 GPM at 40-60 PSI. Electric in-tank pump provides: constant pressure regardless of engine speed, more volume capacity, quiet operation. Installation: drain tank, remove old sending unit, install new pump/sender assembly with check valve and filter. Cost $200-500.</p><h3>Fuel Pressure Regulator</h3><p>Maintains constant fuel pressure despite engine speed/load variations. Vacuum-actuated regulator varies pressure with intake manifold vacuum (reduces pressure at cruise, increases at full throttle). Mechanical bypass regulator diverts excess fuel back to tank. Typical regulator cost $100-200. Essential for consistent carburetor operation and fuel injection stability.</p></section><section id=cooling><h2>Cooling System Integration</h2><h3>Radiator Sizing</h3><p>Cooling capacity (BTU/hour) = Power (kW) × 3412.5 / Efficiency. High-power engine 350 kW with 80% efficiency needs 3412.5 × 350 / 0.8 = 1.49 million BTU/hr cooling. Radiator core size proportional to cooling capacity: core thickness 40mm core = 500 W/°C capability. Engine-radiator temperature difference typically 15-20°C (engine 90°C, radiator outlet 70-75°C). Oversizing radiator improves cooling and reduces fan load.</p><h3>Water Pump Compatibility</h3><p>Original water pump flow rate (GPM) limited. New high-power engine requires higher flow. Centrifugal pump flow = impeller area × blade velocity. Larger pump, higher RPM, or different blade pitch increases flow. Swapped engine may require different water pump (different shaft size, different mounting). Custom shaft coupler ($100-200) or pulley adapter allows old pump pulley to drive new engine pump shaft.</p><h3>Thermostat & Temperature Control</h3><p>Standard thermostat opens at 82°C, fully open 93°C. High-power engine running hot may need higher temperature threshold (88°C opening, 100°C full open) to reduce coolant flow restriction. Electronic fan switch turns fan on at 88°C, off at 82°C, improving efficiency. Manual electric fan (always on at idle, excessive noise and power) vs automatic (fan on demand, efficient and quiet).</p></section><section id=electrical><h2>Electrical System Modifications</h2><h3>Charging System Upgrade</h3><p>Original alternator 60-80 amp output sufficient for original ignition and accessories. New engine with fuel injection, electronic controls, upgraded electronics may demand 100-150 amps. Original alternator insufficient; battery slowly discharges. Upgrade alternator: high-output unit (120-200 amps) produces more power but adds engine load (reduces horsepower slightly). Cost $400-800.</p><h3>Wiring Harness Conversion</h3><p>Original vehicle carburetor/points ignition minimal wiring. New fuel injection engine complex wiring: fuel pump relay, fuel injector drivers, ignition coil drivers, oxygen sensor, throttle position sensor, knock sensor, EGR solenoid, etc. Original wiring harness incompatible. Options: (1) Standalone engine management computer (piggyback) adapts signals. (2) New complete wiring harness from donor vehicle (expensive, requires extensive fitting). (3) Custom wiring (complex but most reliable long-term).</p><h3>Ignition & Starting</h3><p>Original points ignition may be mechanically inadequate for new engine. Electronic ignition module or distributorless system (DIS) with coil packs improves reliability and efficiency. Starter motor: new engine higher compression may require more starting torque. Original starter struggles; upgrade to high-torque starter (heavier, draws more current, 150-200 amps).</p></section><section id=wood-gas><h2>Wood Gas Conversion</h2><h3>Gasifier Principle</h3><p>Wood or charcoal heated in low-oxygen environment (600-800°C) produces combustible gas: carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H₂), methane (CH₄), nitrogen (N₂), plus tars and water vapor. Combustible gas 25-30% energy content of original gasoline (by volume), requiring 3-4× larger fuel storage. Gas fed to engine through mixing valve (replaces carburetor intake). Engine runs on mixture: 50% wood gas, 50% air.</p><h3>Gasifier Types</h3><p><strong>Downdraft:</strong> Wood burns at top, gas flows downward through coal bed, exiting at bottom. Compact design, good for mobile applications. Tar content in exhaust problematic; requires cooler and tar extractor.</p><p><strong>Updraft:</strong> Coal bed at bottom, wood stacked above, hot gas drawn upward through coal. More efficient, less tar, simpler operation. Requires larger physical size.</p><p><strong>Cross-draft:</strong> Least common, compact, moderate tar.</p><h3>System Integration</h3><p>Gasifier mounted on vehicle, fed with firewood/charcoal during operation. Trip to forest every 50-100 km to gather wood (for continuous rural travel). Startup requires 10-20 minutes warm-up (gasifier reaching operating temperature). Cold start difficult; may require brief gasoline primer to light gasifier. Efficiency poor (35% vs 25% gasoline engine = similar overall efficiency despite low fuel calorific value). Maintenance: weekly ash removal, monthly tar trap cleaning.</p><h3>Practical Limitations</h3><p>Slow startup unsuitable for quick urban trips. Limited range (heavy wood/charcoal load). Odor from wood smoke. Environmental (if resource available sustainably). Most practical for remote rural vehicles with predictable routes and available wood resources. Not street-legal in most regions (emissions not certified).</p></section><section id=biodiesel><h2>Biodiesel Fuel Preparation</h2><h3>Biodiesel Production</h3><p>Vegetable oil transesterified (treated with catalyst, typically sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide) to break triglyceride chains into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) and glycerin. Process: (1) Mix vegetable oil with methanol and catalyst. (2) Stir 1-2 hours (exothermic, heat generated). (3) Settle 8-12 hours, allowing biodiesel and glycerin to separate. (4) Drain glycerin layer. (5) Wash biodiesel with water, dry. Yield: 1 liter vegetable oil produces ~0.95 liters biodiesel.</p><h3>Engine Compatibility</h3><p>Biodiesel compatible with diesel engines with minimal modification. B20 (20% biodiesel, 80% diesel) approved for all modern diesel vehicles. B100 (pure biodiesel) requires fuel filter upgrades (biodiesel dissolves gum deposits, clogging original filter). Cold flow improves with additives or heating (biodiesel gels at -5°C, requiring fuel line heaters in winter).</p><h3>Engine Modifications for Biodiesel</h3><p>Fuel filter upgrade: finer mesh (5-10 µm) traps dissolved gum. Biodiesel tank coating: rubber seals swell slightly (acceptable), paint stripped by biodiesel (non-issue for steel tanks). Injector cleaning intervals shorter (biodiesel combustion leaves more carbon, requiring fuel system cleaning annually). Cost: $300-500 for fuel filter and cleaning supplies.</p><h3>Sourcing Feedstock</h3><p>Vegetable oil sources: cooking oil (waste from restaurants), canola oil, soybean oil. Waste cooking oil cheapest ($0.10-0.50/liter). Fresh vegetable oil more expensive ($0.80-1.50/liter). Animal fat (tallow) also works but requires higher temperature transesterification.</p></section><section id=ethanol><h2>Ethanol Fuel Conversion</h2><h3>E85 Engine Conversion</h3><p>Ethanol (85%) + gasoline (15%) fuel with 105-112 octane rating (much higher than 87-89 octane gasoline). Requires: (1) Fuel injectors delivering 25% more volume (higher fuel consumption of ethanol). (2) Ignition timing adjusted (different combustion speed). (3) Cold-start enrichment control (ethanol poor volatility at cold temps). (4) Fuel filter/pump compatible with ethanol (some plastics swell).</p><h3>Flex-Fuel Conversion</h3><p>Factory flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs) equipped to run E85 or 100% gasoline automatically. Fuel blend sensor detects ethanol content, adjusts fuel injection and ignition timing accordingly. Sensor signal: low voltage = gasoline, high voltage = E85. Aftermarket flex-fuel kits ($800-2,000) adapt carburetor or EFI vehicles to run E85, but requires tuning and calibration. Less common than factory FFVs.</p><h3>Performance vs Efficiency</h3><p>Ethanol higher octane = higher boost/compression possible = more power (typically 5-15% power increase on boost). Ethanol energy content 67% gasoline = 25-30% higher fuel consumption. Net efficiency similar to gasoline: more power but more fuel consumed. Better for performance-oriented conversions, not economy-focused vehicles.</p></section><section id=electric><h2>Electric Vehicle Conversion Basics</h2><h3>Component List for EV Conversion</h3><p>(1) Electric motor: AC induction (50-200 kW typical), brushless DC, or Tesla-style permanent-magnet AC. (2) Battery pack: lithium (modern), lead-acid (cheap, heavy), or other chemistry. Capacity 20-100 kWh (30-50 miles range typical). (3) DC-DC converter: steps down 400V battery to 12V for lights, accessories. (4) Motor controller: drives motor at variable speed, regenerative braking. (5) Onboard charger: converts AC mains to DC for battery charging. (6) Mechanical components: motor coupling to transmission, brake pedal force sensor (regenerative braking), accelerator throttle sensor.</p><h3>Motor Selection</h3><p><strong>AC induction:</strong> Robust, efficient (90-95%), high torque at low speed. Requires 3-phase inverter. Heavier than DC for same power.</p><p><strong>Brushless DC (BLDC):</strong> Lightweight, efficient (90-95%), lower torque at low speed. Requires electronic commutation.</p><p><strong>Permanent-magnet AC:</strong> Tesla motor type, very efficient (95%), high power density. Expensive ($10,000-20,000 used).</p><h3>Battery System Design</h3><p>Total energy = Range desired × Consumption per mile. A 100-mile range car consuming 200 Wh/mile needs 20 kWh. Cost: lithium $10,000-15,000, lead-acid $3,000-5,000. Battery management system (BMS) monitors cell voltage, temperature, enforces charge limits (prevents overcharge, overdischarge). Without BMS, lithium battery fails suddenly (internal short, fire risk).</p><h3>Range & Charging</h3><p>Modern lithium EV: 200-300 miles per charge. Charging time: 240V Level 2 home charger (30A, 7 kW) charges 20 kWh battery in ~3 hours. DC fast charger 50-150 kW charges to 80% in 20-30 minutes. Conversion economics: conversion cost $20,000-40,000 + lost original engine parts value. Payback period 5-10 years through fuel savings (electricity $0.03/mile vs gasoline $0.10/mile). Better for high-mileage urban vehicles than occasional drivers.</p></section><div class=warning><strong>Safety Warning:</strong> Engine swaps involve high-temperature coolant, pressurized fuel systems, and electrical hazards. Improper engine installation can cause engine fire, fuel system rupture, or catastrophic failure at high speed. All modifications must be completed professionally or under expert supervision. Battery systems in EV conversions store enormous energy and can cause electrocution (400V = fatal). Never work on vehicle electrical while battery connected. Mechanical modifications affect vehicle braking, handling, and crash safety—modified vehicles may fail safety inspections and lack insurance coverage.</strong></div><div class=tip><strong>Planning Tip:</strong> Before starting any conversion, research completed examples (forums, YouTube channels). Conversion difficulty ranges from trivial (carb-to-fuel-injection adapter, one afternoon) to extreme (body-on-frame rebuild, months of work). Evaluate mechanical skill, tool availability, and realistic timeline before committing. Budget 1.5-2× estimated costs for unexpected issues and parts unavailability.</div><div class=related role="navigation" aria-label="Related guides"><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href=internal-combustion.html>Internal Combustion Engines</a><a href=electrical-motors.html>Electric Motors</a><a href=automotive-alternator-repurposing.html>Alternator Repurposing</a><a href=electrical-wiring.html>Electrical Wiring</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium &mdash; Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
