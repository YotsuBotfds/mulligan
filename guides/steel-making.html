Pure iron is soft and weak. Carbon atoms interrupt crystal lattice, increasing strength and hardness but reducing ductility. Iron-carbon phase diagram shows that austenite (FCC crystal structure, holds carbon in solution) at high temperature rapidly transforms to ferrite + cementide (pearlite) on cooling, creating hardened structure.</p><p>Wrought iron (pure iron, <0.08% carbon) is malleable, weldable, corrosion-resistant but weak. Cast iron (2-4% carbon) is brittle but easily cast. Steel (0.1-2% carbon) balances strength, hardness, and workability - most useful material.</p><svg viewbox='0 0 650 400' style='background:#1a2e1a;margin:20px 0;border-radius:8px;max-width:100%;height:auto' aria-label='Steel Making diagram 1'><rect width="650" height="400" fill="#1a2e1a"></rect><text x="325" y="30" fill="#d4a574" font-size="18" font-weight="bold" text-anchor="middle">Blast Furnace Cross-Section</text><path d='M 150 80 L 180 100 L 180 320 L 170 350 L 130 350 L 120 320 L 120 100 Z' fill="none" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2/"><text x="150" y="120" fill="#d4a574" font-size="11" font-weight="bold" text-anchor="middle">Stack Zone</text><text x="150" y="135" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="9" text-anchor="middle">(Preheating)</text><path d='M 180 200 L 220 200 L 220 280 L 180 280 Z' fill="none" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="2/"><text x="200" y="235" fill="#d4a574" font-size="11" text-anchor="middle">Furnace</text><text x="200" y="250" fill="#d4a574" font-size="10" text-anchor="middle">Proper</text><text x="200" y="265" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="9" text-anchor="middle">(1600-1700°C)</text><path d='M 220 240 L 260 240 L 265 250 L 260 260 L 220 260' fill="#8b5a2b" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="1/"><text x="280" y="250" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="9">Molten Iron</text><path d='M 220 280 L 220 310 L 240 330 L 200 330 L 200 310 Z' fill="none" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="2/"><text x="220" y="320" fill="#d4a574" font-size="10" text-anchor="middle">Hearth</text><text x="280" y="290" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="9">Slag layer (lighter)</text><text x="280" y="310" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="9">Tap holes at bottom</text><line x1="80" y1="100" x2="60" y2="80" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2/"><text x="35" y="85" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="9">Ore + Coke</text><text x="35" y="100" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="8">Feed (top)</text><line x1="100" y1="200" x2="70" y2="200" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="3/"><text x="50" y="195" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="9">Hot air blast</text><text x="50" y="210" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="8">(800-1000°C)</text><circle cx="410" cy="200" r="100" fill="none" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2" stroke-dasharray="5,5"></circle><text x="410" y="180" fill="#d4a574" font-size="11" text-anchor="middle">Temperature</text><text x="410" y="200" fill="#d4a574" font-size="10" text-anchor="middle">Profile</text><text x="410" y="225" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="9" text-anchor="middle">Top: ~200°C</text><text x="410" y="240" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="9" text-anchor="middle">Middle: ~1000°C</text><text x="410" y="255" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="9" text-anchor="middle">Furnace: ~1700°C</text><line x1="240" y1="340" x2="240" y2="370" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2/"><text x="260" y="360" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="9">Iron output</text><text x="260" y="375" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="9">(pig iron, 4-5% C)</text></svg></section><section id="ore-processing"><h2>Ore Processing and Reduction</h2><p>Iron ore contains iron oxides (hematite Fe₂O₃, magnetite Fe₃O₄, limonite 2Fe₂O₃·3H₂O) mixed with silica (SiO₂) gangue. Reduction occurs via: Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂, or Fe₂O₃ + 3H₂ → 2Fe + 3H₂O. Carbon monoxide (from coke burning) is preferred reducer in traditional furnaces.</p><h3>Ore Preparation</h3><p>Crush ore to <25mm particles. Roast at 800-900°C to remove moisture, convert limonite to hematite (Fe₂O₃), and expose internal surfaces. Roasting 2-4 hours in open air blast or kiln. Cooled ore is friable (crumbly), easier to load into furnace.</p><h3>Coke Production</h3><p>Coke (nearly pure carbon) is superior fuel to charcoal for blast furnaces - higher temperature, better permeability, higher carbon concentration. Coal heated to 1000-1200°C without air (destructive distillation) produces coke. Traditional method: heap coal 2-3m tall, cover with turf/clay to restrict air, ignite top, allow slow burn (weeks). Modern: industrial retort coking over hours. Result: 80% of coal weight becomes coke, 20% lost as volatiles/ash. For small operations, hardwood charcoal acceptable substitute, though flame temperature lower (~1500°C vs. 1800°C with coke).</p></section><section id="bloomery"><h2>Bloomery Furnaces</h2><p>Ancient furnaces (2000+ years) still viable for small-scale iron production. Simpler than blast furnaces, lower throughput but reliable.</p><h3>Basic Operation</h3><p>Bloomery is pit furnace (~1m diameter, 1-2m deep) lined with clay. Load alternate layers: charcoal at bottom 30cm, ore 10-15cm, charcoal, ore, etc. Fire from top with air blast (bellows). Temperature reaches 1100-1300°C (red heat). At this temperature, iron cannot fully melt (melting point 1538°C) but becomes plastic/spongy. Carbon from charcoal dissolves into iron forming decarburized outer layer (wrought iron). Run continuously 8-12 hours until large mass (bloom) accumulates at furnace bottom. Remove bloom and hammer repeatedly while hot (red heat) to squeeze out slag, consolidate metal, and remove oxide skin.</p><h3>Bloom Yield</h3><p>Starting charge: 100kg ore + 30kg charcoal typically yields 20-30kg wrought iron bloom (20-30% ore reduction efficiency). Remaining material: slag (iron silicates) which flows into pit bottom, charcoal ash. Bloom requires extensive consolidation hammering - yields 15-20kg usable iron after smithing.</p></section><section id="blast-furnace"><h2>Blast Furnace Basics</h2><p>Large-scale furnace (5-15m tall, 2-4m diameter) produces pig iron (cast iron with 3-5% carbon). Advantages: continuous operation, higher temperature (1600-1700°C), molten iron separation from slag. Disadvantages: higher capital cost, requires hot air blast generation, more skill.</p><h3>Essential Components</h3><ol><li><strong>Stack:</strong> Conical vessel narrowing toward furnace proper. Ore/coke loaded at top fall through preheating zone<li><strong>Furnace proper:</strong> Hottest zone where reduction occurs and iron melts<li><strong>Hearth:</strong> Bottom collection zone - molten iron drains via tap hole to collection vessel<li><strong>Tuyeres:</strong> Pipes injecting hot air (air blast). Located above hearth, angled slightly downward<li><strong>Bellows system:</strong> Generate air blast 0.5-2 m³/minute at 30-50 kPa pressure. Hand-operated (labor-intensive) or water-wheel driven (traditional power)</ol><h3>Furnace Chemistry</h3><p>Zone 1 (Stack, 200-900°C): Preheating of ore/coke, initial water removal. Zone 2 (Bosh, 900-1600°C): Active reduction. Fe₂O₃ → Fe₃O₄ → FeO → Fe as temperature increases. Carbon monoxide (produced from coke oxidation) is primary reducer. Zone 3 (Furnace proper, 1600-1700°C): Iron melts, absorbs carbon (becomes cast iron), dissolves in molten slag. Slag composition (SiO₂ + CaO) becomes liquid, floats on iron, protects it from oxygen.</p><h3>Pig Iron Characteristics</h3><p>Contains 3-5% carbon (sometimes up to 8%), 0.5-3% silicon, 0.1-2% manganese, 0.1-1% phosphorus, 0.05-0.15% sulfur. Very brittle - cannot be forged. Must be remelted for casting or refined (carbon removed) to produce wrought iron/steel. Pig iron easily cast (low melting point 1150-1200°C) but not suitable for tools/weapons without further processing.</p></section><section id="carbon-control"><h2>Carbon Content Control</h2><p>Final product properties depend critically on carbon content. Control achieved through:</p><h3>Direct Reduction (Bloomery)</h3><p>Produces wrought iron (high Fe purity, <0.1% carbon). Achieved by incomplete reduction in bloomery - iron remains solid, carbon doesn't dissolve. Extensive hammering squeezes out remaining carbon and slag.</p><h3>Pig Iron Refinement (Puddling)</h3><p>Convert high-carbon pig iron to lower-carbon wrought iron/steel: (1) melt pig iron in reverberatory furnace at 1200-1300°C, (2) add iron oxide (ore) which oxidizes carbon/silicon: Fe₂O₃ + 3C → 3CO↑ + 2Fe, (3) stir puddle vigorously to expose fresh surface to oxidizing flame, (4) as carbon leaves (CO gas evolution), metal stiffens, (5) collect ball of pasty iron, remove from heat, (6) hammer hot to squeeze out slag and consolidate metal. Result: wrought iron at 0.05-0.1% carbon, or low-carbon steel at 0.2-0.5% carbon depending on incomplete decarburization.</p><h3>Cementation (for Steel)</h3><p>Pack wrought iron bars in charcoal powder, seal in clay vessel, heat to 1000°C for 1-2 weeks. Carbon penetrates iron surface 1-2mm depth (slow diffusion process). Result: outer layer becomes high-carbon steel (0.8-1.2% C), inner remains wrought iron. Blister steel (shows blisters from outgassing). Can be remelted for uniform composition.</p><h3>Crucible Steel</h3><p>Melt pure iron + calculated carbon (charcoal powder) in sealed crucible at 1600°C. Carbon dissolves into liquid iron. Cool controlled to form uniform steel. Labor-intensive but produces consistent high-carbon steel (1.0-1.5% carbon). Superior to blister steel for tooling.</p></section><section id="alloys"><h2>Alloy Steel Production</h2><p>Adding metals to steel creates specialized properties:</p><table><tr><th scope="row">Alloy<th scope="row">% Content<th scope="row">Properties<th scope="row">Applications<tr><td>Manganese<td>0.5-2%<td>Hardness, toughness, wear resistance<td>Tools, rail steel<tr><td>Silicon<td>0.5-2%<td>Strength, spring properties<td>Springs, structural steel<tr><td>Chromium<td>1-5%<td>Corrosion resistance, hardness<td>Stainless steel, cutlery<tr><td>Molybdenum<td>0.2-1%<td>Hardness at high temp, toughness<td>High-speed tools, machinery<tr><td>Tungsten<td>2-20%<td>Very high hardness, heat resistance<td>Cutting tools, dies<tr><td>Vanadium<td>0.1-1%<td>Hardness, toughness, spring properties<td>Tools, springs, gears<tr><td>Nickel<td>1-5%<td>Toughness, impact resistance<td>Armor, machinery</table><p>Addition method: melt steel in crucible, add pure metal or metallic alloy powder, stir until dissolved, pour into mold. High temperatures (>1600°C) required for tungsten/molybdenum addition - challenging for small operations. Alternative: buy alloyed metals if available, melt directly rather than attempting alloying from elements.</p></section><section id="bessemer"><h2>Bessemer Process Fundamentals</h2><p>Industrial breakthrough (1850s) that made steel production economical. Principle: blow air through molten pig iron - oxygen burns out carbon, silicon, manganese, phosphorus. Exothermic reaction heats metal further.</p><h3>Basic Procedure</h3><ol><li>Load 10-20 tons molten pig iron into Bessemer converter (pear-shaped vessel)<li>Close top, lower tuyeres (air pipes) through bottom<li>Blow air at high pressure (air blast) - reaction is vigorous<li>Decarburization: C + O₂ → CO↑ (exothermic, produces flame at converter top)<li>Monitor - flame dies as carbon depletes<li>Remove tuyeres, add carbon/alloy adjustments as needed<li>Pour into ladle (liquid steel <30 minutes before cooling/solidifying)<li>Run time: 20-25 minutes total</ol><h3>Key Reactions</h3><p>C + O₂ → CO | Si + O₂ → SiO₂ | 2Mn + O₂ → 2MnO | 4P + 5O₂ → P₄O₁₀. Heat released keeps metal liquid and very hot. Slag produced floats on surface, can be skimmed or allowed to cool and removed later.</p><h3>Challenges</h3><p>Oxygen burns too much carbon initially, can remove all carbon. Recarburization with small charges of coke/spiegeleisen (iron-manganese-carbon alloy) adjusts final carbon. Excessive heat generation can boil metal (violent), requiring careful control. Phosphorus remains in final steel (causes brittleness at cold temperature) - solved by using low-phosphorus pig iron or basic oxygen furnace modification. For small-scale, impractical due to scale requirements - better to use crucible refining methods.</p></section><section id="crucible"><h2>Crucible Steel</h2><p>Superior method for quality steel production at smaller scale. Melting pure iron or wrought iron + carbon in sealed vessel produces uniform, clean steel.</p><h3>Setup</h3><p><strong>Crucible:</strong> Ceramic (graphite or clay-graphite composite) vessel 2-10 liter capacity, must withstand 1600°C without cracking. Loading: wrought iron chips/scrap (0.5-2kg per liter capacity) + calculated carbon source (charcoal powder, 2-8% by weight depending on desired carbon content).</p><p><strong>Furnace:</strong> Coal or coke fire achieving 1600°C at crucible. Refractory lining (firebrick, clay) prevents heat loss. Air draft essential for flame temperature. Total run: 2-4 hours for crucible to reach temperature and melting.</p><h3>Procedure</h3><ol><li>Preheat crucible at 1000°C for 30 minutes (prevents thermal shock cracking)<li>Place crucible in hottest part of furnace<li>Monitor temperature - should reach 1600°C (bright orange-white heat) within 1-2 hours<li>Metal melts completely - observe by opening peephole<li>Allow 20-30 minutes at temperature for complete dissolution of carbon and degassing (bubbles escape)<li>When ready (metal still, no more bubbles), remove crucible with long tongs, pour into preheated (800°C) steel mold or cast-iron mold<li>Cool slowly (wrap in sand/blankets) for first hour, then allow natural cooling - rapid cooling causes cracking</ol><h3>Product Quality</h3><p>Crucible steel is superior to Bessemer - cleaner (fewer oxides), uniform carbon distribution, better mechanical properties. Each crucible run produces 2-8kg depending on size. Small batches but consistent high quality. Carbon content 0.5-1.5% easily controlled by weight of charcoal charged.</p></section><section id="testing"><h2>Material Testing and Identification</h2><p>Determining carbon content and quality of final product essential for proper application.</p><h3>Spark Test</h3><p>Grind sample against high-speed grinding wheel, observe spark stream: (1) wrought iron: few sparks, short stream, orange color, (2) low-carbon steel (0.1-0.3%C): more sparks, longer stream, orange with slight branching, (3) medium steel (0.3-0.8%C): prolific sparks, branched, yellow-white, (4) high-carbon steel (0.8-1.5%C): very prolific, fine branching, white sparks with little explosions at end, (5) cast iron (3-4%C): short dull sparks, few branches.</p><h3>Hardness Testing</h3><p>File test: hardened steel resists file cutting (file skids across surface). Unhardened soft steel files easily. Cast iron resists file (hardness from brittleness, not strength).</p><p>Scratch test: hardened steel scratches with difficulty; soft iron scratches easily. Useful for quick identification.</p><h3>Breaking Test</h3><p>Heat small sample to cherry-red (~800°C), cool in water (quench). Attempt to break by bending or impact: (1) wrought iron bends severely before breaking, (2) soft steel bends slightly then breaks, (3) hardened high-carbon steel breaks suddenly with crystalline fracture surface (shiny facets), (4) cast iron breaks suddenly with coarse gray surface. Fracture surface analysis reveals crystal size, inclusions, quality.</p><h3>Chemical Composition (Advanced)</h3><p>If sulfuric acid available: dissolve small sample in dilute H₂SO₄. Rate of bubble evolution (hydrogen gas) indicates iron purity - pure iron reacts briskly; phosphorus/sulfur impurities slow reaction. Slag inclusions visible as residue. Not quantitative but useful qualitative check.</p></section></section><section id="alloys-bronze"><h2>Bronze, Pewter, and Solder Alloys</h2><h3>Bronze Compositions</h3><p>Bronze (copper + tin) properties vary with tin percentage. 90% Cu/10% Sn = general purpose tools/bells. 85% Cu/15% Sn = harder, better for bearings. 80% Cu/20% Sn = bell bronze, resonant tone. Casting temperature 2100-2200°F. Bronze stronger than copper, machines cleanly, resists water corrosion (maritime use). Tin lowers melting point, improves castability.</p><h3>Pewter (Lead-Free)</h3><p>Modern pewter: 92% Tin / 6% Antimony / 2% Copper. Melting point 400-500°F. Soft, malleable, takes polish. Safe for eating vessels (lead-free). Historical pewter often contained 20-50% lead - toxic, avoid.</p><h3>Soft Solder (Electrical/Plumbing)</h3><p>60% Tin / 40% Lead (traditional) or 96.5% Tin / 3% Silver / 0.5% Cu (lead-free). Melting point ~183°C. Flows easily, creates watertight joints. Electrical wiring, plumbing connections.</p><h3>Hard Solder (Silver Solder)</h3><p>45% Silver / 30% Copper / 25% Zinc. Melting point ~620°C (torch required). Very strong, excellent corrosion resistance. Jewelry, high-strength mechanical joints.</p><h3>Bloom Decarburization and Wire Drawing</h3><p>Bloom reheat to cherry-red, hammer repeatedly to remove carbon and slag, fold and reheat 5-10 times. Wire drawing: pull rod through progressively smaller holes in draw plate, anneal between passes. Result: uniform precision wire.</p><section id="hardening"><h2>Heat Treatment and Hardening</h2><p>Steel properties dramatically change with thermal processing. The key to tool performance.</p><h3>Hardening Process</h3><p>Heat steel to critical temperature (above which austenite forms, dissolves cementite), cool rapidly (quench): (1) heat in coal fire to bright cherry-red (~750°C) for low-carbon steel, or bright orange-red (~800°C) for medium-carbon steel. Color indicates temperature, (2) plunge into water/oil (water cools faster, oil more controlled), (3) result: hard brittle steel - excessive hardness makes tools prone to chipping, (4) temper by reheating to 200-400°C (exact temperature depends on color: pale yellow for max hardness/brittleness, straw yellow for balance, purple/blue for toughness). Cool naturally.</p><h3>Tempering Color Guide</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Color<th scope="row">Temperature<th scope="row">Hardness<th scope="row">Toughness<th scope="row">Application<tr><td>Pale Yellow<td>~200°C<td>Maximum<td>Minimum<td>Razors, high-speed tools<tr><td>Straw Yellow<td>~220°C<td>Very High<td>Low<td>Chisels, plane blades<tr><td>Brown<td>~240°C<td>High<td>Moderate<td>Knives, tool steels<tr><td>Purple<td>~280°C<td>Moderate<td>High<td>Springs, hammers<tr><td>Blue<td>~310°C<td>Low<td>Very High<td>Axes, cold chisels</table><p>Color indicates temperature by oxide film thickness on heated steel surface - useful when pyrometer unavailable.
