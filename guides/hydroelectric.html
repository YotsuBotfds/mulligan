Turbine intercepts moving water, converting kinetic energy to rotational mechanical energy (torque × angular velocity). Generator converts mechanical rotation to electrical power. Overall efficiency: hydraulic (60-90%) × mechanical bearing losses (2-3%) × electrical generator (90-95%) = 50-80% system efficiency.</p><h3>Power Available Formula</h3><p>Power (watts) = 9800 × Head (meters) × Flow (m³/s) × Efficiency. Example: 5 meter head, 0.1 m³/s flow, 70% efficiency = 9800 × 5 × 0.1 × 0.7 = 3,430 watts continuous power. This is the same as 3.43 horsepower. A household using 5 kW average power needs higher flow or head to achieve continuous generation.</p><h3>Efficiency Factors</h3><p><strong>Hydraulic efficiency:</strong> Depends on turbine type matching head and flow. Pelton wheels highly efficient (85-90%) at high head. Crossflow turbines 60-75% at low head. Mis-matched turbine (high-head turbine on low head) produces poor efficiency.</p><p><strong>Penstock friction loss:</strong> Water flowing through pipe loses energy to friction. Long pipes, small diameter, rough interior = high loss. 5% loss acceptable rule-of-thumb; aim for 3-5%.</p><p><strong>Generator efficiency:</strong> Large generators 95%+ efficient. Small generators 85-90% efficient. Oversized generator running at 10% capacity loses efficiency; match generator to expected load.</p></section><section id="power-calc"><h2>Power Calculations & Optimization</h2><h3>Head Measurement</h3><p>Head = vertical distance from water surface at intake to water surface at discharge (tail water level). NOT pipe length (pipe runs along slope, head is vertical drop). Measure with: (1) Clinometer and distance (measure angle and distance from intake to discharge point), (2) Altimeter (measure elevation at intake and discharge), (3) Water barometer (measure pressure difference). For small systems: simple method is string with weight hanging in both locations, measuring vertical distance.</p><h3>Flow Measurement</h3><p>Simple method: bucket and stopwatch. Collect water in bucket for known time (30-60 seconds minimum for accuracy). Divide bucket volume by time in seconds = flow in liters/sec. Repeat 3-5 times, average. More accurate: Orifice plate or weir (notch in pipe), measuring water height and calculating flow from hydraulic tables. Seasonal variation important: winter (wet season) higher flow, summer (dry season) lower flow. Micro-hydro sizing should account for minimum expected flow.</p><h3>System Power vs Load Power</h3><p>Power available ≠ usable power. If system generates 5 kW but daily household load averages 2 kW, system is oversized. Excess water spills (wasted potential). Undersized system (2 kW available, 5 kW load) means load cannot be fully supplied continuously. Battery storage bridges difference: surplus power charges battery, loads discharge when generation insufficient. Storage size = (Peak load - Available power) × Hours autonomy.</p></section><section id="turbine-types"><h2>Turbine Types & Selection</h2><h3>Pelton Wheel</h3><p>High-head turbine (30-300m typical). Free-jet design: nozzle directs water stream onto buckets (cups) mounted on wheel. Each bucket has inner split (splitter) directing water away from next bucket without collision. Efficiency 85-90%. Speed: high head = high speed (can directly drive generator). Rotor buckets must be precisely machined for efficiency. Manual adjustment nozzle to decrease water flow and load when electricity demand drops.</p><h3>Turgo Wheel</h3><p>Similar to Pelton but jet angle (20-25°) allows water to enter and exit on different sides. More compact than Pelton, simpler buckets. Medium-head (10-30m). Efficiency 80-85%. Can operate at higher speeds (higher specific speed) than Pelton.</p><h3>Francis Turbine</h3><p>Reaction turbine: water pressure relative to atmosphere provides force (unlike Pelton's free-jet). Water enters spirally around rotor, traveling inward and downward over curved blades, exiting axially below. Medium head (5-20m), large flow. Efficiency 85-90%. More complex than Pelton; sensitive to size changes. Requires civil works (concrete spiral casing). Runner blades must be precisely manufactured.</p><h3>Crossflow (Turgo-Like) Turbine</h3><p>Simplest turbine for low head (1-10m), medium-high flow. Water enters curved bucket at 20° angle, crosses rotor, exits opposite side. Efficiency 60-75% (lower than high-tech turbines but simple). Can be fabricated from PVC pipe and welded steel. DIY-friendly: bucket welded together, runner disk bolted on. Low-cost, easy maintenance.</p><h3>Water Screw (Archimedean)</h3><p>Inclined screw rotated by flowing water. Recent development for micro-hydro. Very low head (0.5-5m). Efficiency 60-75%. Extremely fish-friendly (no pressure drop, damage, or turbulent mixing). Simple operation. Limited to low head; not suitable for moderate/high head sites.</p></section><section id="pelton-svg"><h2>Pelton Wheel Diagram</h2><svg viewbox='0 0 600 500' xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="background:#2d2416" aria-label='Hydroelectric Systems diagram 1'><defs><lineargradient id="bucketGrad" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="100%"><stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#b8956a;stop-opacity:1"></stop><stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#6b5344;stop-opacity:1"></stop></lineargradient><lineargradient id="waterGrad" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="0%" y2="100%"><stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#4a7fb5;stop-opacity:1"></stop><stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#1a4a7a;stop-opacity:1"></stop></lineargradient></defs><text x="20" y="30" font-size="16" fill="#d4a574" font-weight="bold">Pelton Wheel Turbine</text><circle cx="300" cy="280" r="120" fill="none" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2"></circle><circle cx="300" cy="280" r="110" fill="url(#waterGrad)" opacity="0.2"></circle><circle cx="300" cy="280" r="80" fill="none" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2"></circle><g id="buckets"><path d='M 300 160 L 290 180 L 310 180 Z' fill="url(#bucketGrad)" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="1"></path><path d='M 365 205 L 350 215 L 360 235 Z' fill="url(#bucketGrad)" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="1" transform='rotate(45 320 200)'></path><path d='M 380 280 L 370 290 L 380 310 Z' fill="url(#bucketGrad)" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="1" transform='rotate(90 380 280)'></path><path d='M 365 355 L 350 345 L 360 325 Z' fill="url(#bucketGrad)" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="1" transform='rotate(135 330 360)'></path><path d='M 300 400 L 290 380 L 310 380 Z' fill="url(#bucketGrad)" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="1"></path><path d='M 235 355 L 250 345 L 240 325 Z' fill="url(#bucketGrad)" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="1" transform='rotate(-135 270 360)'></path><path d='M 220 280 L 230 290 L 220 310 Z' fill="url(#bucketGrad)" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="1" transform='rotate(-90 220 280)'></path><path d='M 235 205 L 250 215 L 240 235 Z' fill="url(#bucketGrad)" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="1" transform='rotate(-45 280 200)'></path></g><circle cx="300" cy="280" r="8" fill="#d4a574" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2"></circle><line x1="300" y1="160" x2="300" y2="50" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="3"></line><text x="310" y="100" font-size="12" fill="#d4a574" font-weight="bold">Nozzle</text><path d='M 298 60 L 302 60 L 300 40' fill="#4a7fb5" stroke="#1a4a7a" stroke-width="2"></path><path d='M 300 40 L 298 50 M 300 40 L 302 50' stroke="#1a4a7a" stroke-width="2"></path><text x="20" y="450" font-size="12" fill="#d4a574" font-weight="bold">Key Components:</text><text x="20" y="470" font-size="11" fill="#b8956a">- Wheel with buckets (cups) spaced around rotor</text><text x="20" y="485" font-size="11" fill="#b8956a">- High-speed free-jet water stream from nozzle</text><text x="300" y="450" font-size="11" fill="#b8956a">- Splitter inside bucket redirects water</text><text x="300" y="470" font-size="11" fill="#b8956a">- Axle to shaft for power transfer</text></svg></section><section id="ram-pump"><h2>Hydraulic Ram Pump (No External Power Required)</h2><h3>Hydraulic Ram Principle</h3><p>The hydraulic ram (or ram pump) is a unique mechanical pump powered entirely by flowing water. It requires only a water source with vertical drop and continuous flow. No electricity, fuel, or external power needed—the energy comes entirely from the water itself through water hammer effects.</p><h4>Ram Pump Operation and Specifications</h4><ul><li><strong>Water Hammer Effect:</strong> When rapidly flowing water is suddenly stopped by an internal valve, the pressure surge momentarily exceeds normal static pressure many times over, creating a powerful pumping action.</li><li><strong>Unique Performance Metric:</strong> Lifts approximately 10% of intake flow to 10 times the original head. Example: 3-foot head, 100 GPM intake flow → 10 GPM pumped uphill to 30-foot elevation.</li><li><strong>No External Power:</strong> All energy comes from the flowing water itself. Unlike conventional pumps, requires no electricity or fuel input.</li><li><strong>Efficiency Rating:</strong> Achieves 60-80% overall efficiency, which is excellent for a completely passive system.</li><li><strong>Pulsing Operation:</strong> Produces rhythmic pulse (typically 40-80 pulses per minute). Becomes background noise, not objectionable.</li><li><strong>Minimum Requirements:</strong> Needs at least 3+ feet of vertical head and 5-10 GPM continuous flow to operate efficiently.</li></ul><h4>Drive Pipe Design</h4><p>The intake pipe carrying water to the ram pump requires careful design:</p><ul><li><strong>Optimal Length:</strong> Drive pipe should be 5-12 times the vertical drop length. Example: 10-foot head → 50-120 feet of drive pipe optimal.</li><li><strong>Pipe Diameter:</strong> Larger diameter increases water momentum (better efficiency); smaller diameter makes pump pulse faster (more cycles per minute).</li><li><strong>Material:</strong> Steel pipe preferred (better water hammer transmission); PVC acceptable if pressure-rated adequately.</li></ul></section><section id="penstock"><h2>Penstock Design & Sizing</h2><h3>Penstock Pressure Calculation</h3><p>The main penstock carrying water to the turbine must be designed for the maximum static pressure at the lowest point:</p><p><strong>Pressure (PSI) = Head (feet) × 0.433</strong></p><p>Example: 100-foot head creates 100 × 0.433 = 43.3 PSI at the bottom of the penstock. Pipe must be rated for this pressure plus a 25-50% safety margin (54+ PSI rating recommended).</p><h3>Pipe Material Selection</h3><p><strong>Steel:</strong> Strong, durable, heavy. Corroded by water with oxygen; requires interior/exterior coating. Cost $500-1500 per 100 meters installed. Lifespan 50+ years with maintenance.</p><p><strong>Plastic (PVC, HDPE):</strong> Lightweight, easy install, no corrosion. PVC brittle (temperature sensitive), HDPE flexible. Cost $300-800 per 100 meters. Lifespan 20-30 years. Pressure rated 100-300 PSI typical.</p><p><strong>Bamboo or wooden stave:</strong> Traditional in Asia, low cost if materials available. Requires banding and leakage acceptance. Lifespan 5-15 years.</p><h3>Diameter Calculation</h3><p>Larger diameter = lower friction loss = higher efficiency but higher cost. Rule of thumb: velocity in penstock 0.5-2 m/s (lower velocity = larger pipe but less loss). At 1 m/s: Diameter = 1.13 × √(Flow in m³/s). Example: 0.05 m³/s flow requires 0.25 m (250mm) diameter for 1 m/s velocity. Longer penstock requires larger diameter to keep velocity low (friction loss accumulates with distance).</p><h3>Pressure Rating</h3><p>Pressure = 0.1 × Head in meters (metric). A 100-meter head creates 10 bar (145 PSI) pressure at bottom of penstock. Pipe pressure rating must exceed this plus 20% safety margin (12 bar rating minimum). Higher head requires stronger (thicker wall or better material) pipe, increasing cost exponentially.</p><h3>Friction Loss Calculation</h3><p>Head loss (m) = (f × L × V²) / (2 × g × D) where f is friction factor (~0.02-0.03 for PVC), L is pipe length, V is velocity, D is diameter, g = 9.81. Example: 100m pipe, 0.05 m³/s flow, 0.25m diameter: V = 0.05/(π×0.125²) = 1 m/s. Head loss = (0.025 × 100 × 1²) / (2 × 9.81 × 0.25) = 0.51 meters. This is acceptable (0.5% of 100m head).</p></section><section id="head-flow"><h2>Head & Flow Measurement Methods</h2><h3>Measuring Head Accurately</h3><p>Best method: Altimeter-based. Record elevation at water intake and discharge points using GPS with barometric altimeter. Elevation difference = head. Cost: GPS unit $100-300.</p><p>Budget method: Water manometer (tube with water). Create siphon from intake water to discharge point, measuring height difference where water levels equalize. More complex but free materials.</p><p>Field method: Clinometer and tape. Measure angle from intake to discharge using protractor/smartphone clinometer app. Distance = horizontal distance along stream / cos(angle). Head = distance × sin(angle).</p><h3>Measuring Flow Seasonally</h3><p>Flow varies throughout year. Measure at three seasons minimum: dry season (minimum expected flow), wet season (maximum), and spring runoff (if applicable). Use smallest seasonal flow for sizing (conservatively ensures system works year-round). System can shed excess water in high-flow season (spillway dam overflow). Micro-hydro systems typically generate variable power; battery storage buffers variability.</p><h3>Site Survey Checklist</h3><p>Water source location and elevation. Discharge point elevation. Distance from intake to powerhouse. Obstructions, cliffs, obstacles. Land access for construction. Permits required (water rights, environmental review). Proximity to buildings/roads (noise consideration). Maintenance access (annual cleanout of sediment in settling basin).</p></section><section id="governor"><h2>Governor Control Systems</h2><h3>Mechanical Governor (Pelton Wheel)</h3><p>Nozzle needle position controlled by flyweights (centrifugal governor). As load increases (water draws more power), frequency/speed drops slightly. Flyweights respond to drop in speed, mechanically moving needle to open nozzle wider (increase water). System stabilizes at new equilibrium where water input matches load. Droop: system runs at slightly lower frequency under load (typically 3-5% droop acceptable). Simple, no electricity needed.</p><h3>Electronic Load Controller (ELC)</h3><p>Senses generator frequency via voltage monitoring. When load drops (frequency rises), ELC diverts excess water to spill load (resistive heater or dump valve). When load increases (frequency drops), ELC closes spill load, restoring frequency. Spill load (100Ω resistor bank dissipating 5 kW as heat, or proportional valve dumping water) consumes excess power. Maintains constant frequency within 1% without mechanical governor adjustment.</p><h3>Frequency Maintenance</h3><p>Grid-connected systems must maintain 60 Hz (or 50 Hz in some countries) for synchronous operation with utility. Stand-alone systems can operate 50-65 Hz typically. Low frequency damages motors and electronic equipment. High frequency risks generator overspeed (mechanical failure). Frequency = (RPM × Poles) / 120. A 1800 RPM 4-pole generator = exactly 60 Hz. Slight RPM variation due to governor droop causes frequency drift.</p></section><section id="system-design"><h2>Complete System Design Example</h2><h3>Site Specs</h3><p>Head: 25 meters. Flow: 0.2 m³/s (200 liters/sec). Power available: 9800 × 25 × 0.2 × 0.7 = 34,300 watts (34.3 kW). Daily household load: 50 kWh (average 2.1 kW). Seasonal flow variation: minimum 0.1 m³/s (winter low), maximum 0.3 m³/s (spring runoff).</p><h3>Component Selection</h3><p><strong>Turbine:</strong> Turgo wheel for 25m head and 0.2 m³/s flow. Efficiency 85%. Matches head/flow profile well. Cost $5,000-8,000.</p><p><strong>Generator:</strong> 30 kW 3-phase AC alternator (matches available power). Cost $3,000-5,000. Oversizing by 10% accounts for efficiency losses.</p><p><strong>Penstock:</strong> 0.25m diameter steel pipe, 1 m/s velocity, 500m length. Head loss ≈ 2.5m (reduces effective head to 22.5m). Cost $15,000-20,000 (major expense).</p><p><strong>Battery storage:</strong> Lithium battery 10 kWh for 5 hours autonomy (covers daily variation). Cost $5,000-8,000. Alternative: no storage, accept load variation (30-60 kW available, load requires 2.1 kW average + 5 kW peak).</p><p><strong>Governor:</strong> Electronic load controller with 10 kW spill load (resistor heater) dumps excess power during low-load periods. Cost $2,000-3,000.</p><h3>Total System Cost</h3><p>Turbine + Generator + Penstock + Battery + Electronics + Civil works (dam, settling basin, powerhouse) = $40,000-60,000 installed. Annual output: 34 kW × 8760 hours × 0.7 efficiency = 207,000 kWh/year (valued at $20,000 at residential rates). Payback period: 2-3 years in ideal conditions (good head/flow, expensive local electricity).</p></section><section id="maintenance"><h2>Maintenance & Troubleshooting</h2><h3>Sediment Management</h3><p>High water flow carries sediment (sand, silt, gravel). Settling basin (large pond before penstock intake) allows sediment to settle, protecting turbine buckets from abrasion and erosion. Annual cleanout required in areas with heavy sediment load. Screen at intake (1-2 mm mesh) prevents leaves and debris from entering penstock.</p><h3>Freezing & Seasonal</h3><p>Cold climate: water in penstock may freeze (blocking flow). Insulation or burial 2+ meters deep prevents freezing. Winter start-up: warm water through system before applying full load to prevent thermal shock cracking. Dry season planning: assume 50% nominal flow for minimum system design.</p><h3>Common Issues</h3><p><strong>Low power output:</strong> Sediment clogging nozzle (clean intake screen). Penstock leak (loss visible). Bucket wear (buckets concave from erosion). Check frequency: if low, turbine not turning fast enough (flow reduction or governor not opening nozzle).</p><p><strong>Noise:</strong> Cavitation (water boiling in low-pressure zones, creating bubble collapse noise). Occurs when water velocity too high or pressure drops too low. Reduce nozzle opening or increase penstock diameter.</p><p><strong>Vibration:</strong> Unbalanced rotor (bucket damage). Out-of-alignment coupling between turbine and generator. Bearing wear (play in rotor).</p></section><div class="warning"><strong>Safety Warning:</strong> High-head water systems store enormous potential energy. A penstock failure releases water with devastating force. Never work on penstock under pressure (pressure is always present with water flowing). Tie off pipes firmly with proper support; kinetic energy of 100,000 liters moving at 10 m/s can shift piping. Water velocity in small diameter penstock can exceed 5 m/s; never place body in water stream path (velocity can cause injury). Always drain penstock before maintenance on pipe or turbine.</strong></div><div class="tip"><strong>Design Tip:</strong> Settling basin provides multiple benefits: sediment removal, water buffering (absorbs sudden flow changes, reducing spill load fluctuations), organism destruction (time in basin kills some microorganisms). Size basin for 10-30 minute residence time: at 0.2 m³/s, need 120-360 m³ storage = roughly 6m × 10m × 2m deep. Deeper basins reduce disturbance to settled sediment.</div><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="electrical-generation.html">Power Generation</a><a href="electrical-wiring.html">Electrical Wiring</a><a href="power-distribution.html">Power Distribution</a><a href="internal-combustion.html">Internal Combustion Engines</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
