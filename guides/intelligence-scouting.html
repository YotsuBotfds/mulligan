Each iteration improves your understanding and response capability. Never skip analysis—raw observations without interpretation lead to poor decisions.</p></section><section id=patrol-types><h2>Patrol Types</h2><p><strong>Presence Patrol:</strong> High-visibility movement through community territory. Primary purpose is deterrence and reassurance. Regular, predictable patrols signal strength and attentiveness.</p><p><strong>Reconnaissance Patrol:</strong> 2-3 person team moving quietly to observe and report on specific areas. Focus on gathering information about activities, threats, and changes. Do not engage unless necessary.</p><p><strong>Listening Post:</strong> Concealed position held for 4-12 hours where personnel observe and listen for threats or unusual activity. Requires strong noise discipline and patience.</p><p><strong>Area Patrol:</strong> Systematic sweep of defined territory using grid or spiral patterns. Ensures complete coverage and reduces blind spots.</p></section><section id=observation-skills><h2>Observation Skills</h2><p><strong>Baseline Establishment:</strong> Learn what "normal" looks like in your area—typical traffic patterns, time-of-day variations, seasonal changes, and community routines. Anomalies only stand out against a solid baseline.</p><p><strong>SALUTE Reporting:</strong> Standardize observations using Size, Activity, Location, Uniform, Time, Equipment. This format ensures consistent, usable reporting: "Five individuals, moving northeast, near the bridge, armed with rifles, 14:30 hours."</p><p><strong>Tracking Indicators:</strong> Look for signs of passage—disturbed vegetation, footprints, freshly broken branches, ash, cigarette butts. Learn to read ground sign and movement patterns.</p><p><strong>Night Observation:</strong> Allow 30 minutes of dark adaptation before night operations. Use peripheral vision, which is more sensitive to motion in low light. Avoid looking directly at objects in darkness.</p></section><section id=counter-surveillance><h2>Counter-Surveillance</h2><p><strong>Pattern Avoidance:</strong> Never follow predictable routes or schedules. Vary your movements, timing, and methods. Predictability makes you vulnerable.</p><p><strong>Sound Discipline:</strong> Minimize noise from equipment, movement, and communication. Use hand signals when possible. Keep voices low and speak minimally during observation.</p><p><strong>Light Discipline:</strong> Avoid flashlights and visible light sources. Use red-light filters when light is necessary. Never shine lights in directions that might reveal your position.</p><p><strong>Deception:</strong> Mislead potential observers about your capabilities, positions, and intentions. Use decoys, false movement, and misdirection when appropriate.</p></section><section id=threat-assessment><h2>Threat Assessment Framework</h2><p>Evaluate potential threats using three criteria: <strong>Capability</strong> (what can they do to us?), <strong>Intent</strong> (do they want to do it?), and <strong>Opportunity</strong> (can they access us now?). All three must be present for a real threat. A capable and willing adversary with no opportunity presents minimal immediate danger.</p><p>Threat assessment informs response options: intelligence gathering, defensive preparation, deescalation attempts, or community protection measures. Reassess continuously as conditions change.</p></section><section id=information-management><h2>Information Management</h2><p><strong>Map Board:</strong> Maintain an updated map showing known positions, movements, and areas of interest. Update daily with patrol findings. Use symbols for different information types (threats, resources, community zones).</p><p><strong>Log Books:</strong> Record patrol reports, observations, and incidents chronologically. Include date, time, personnel, observations, and assessment. These logs become historical reference and help identify patterns.</p><p><strong>Need-to-Know Compartmentalization:</strong> Share only necessary information with each person or team. Sensitive intelligence should be restricted to decision makers and affected parties. This limits damage from compromised information.</p></section><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium &mdash; Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
