Two main methods exist: water bath canning for high-acid foods and pressure canning for low-acid foods.</p><h3>Water Bath Canning</h3><p>Suitable for fruits, pickles, jams, and foods with pH below 4.6. Equipment needed: large pot, jar lifter, bubble remover, funnel, clean glass jars with lids and bands.</p><ol><li><strong>Prepare jars:</strong> Wash in hot soapy water. Sterilize by boiling for 10 minutes or keeping in 180°F water until use.</li><li><strong>Prepare lids:</strong> Place metal lids in hot water (not boiling) for 5 minutes before use. Rings can be reused indefinitely.</li><li><strong>Fill jars:</strong> Leave headspace as specified (typically 1/4 to 1/2 inch for most foods). Remove bubbles with a plastic spatula.</li><li><strong>Wipe rims:</strong> Use a clean cloth to remove any food residue ensuring proper seal.</li><li><strong>Apply lids and rings:</strong> Hand-tighten bands—not too tight or steam cannot escape.</li><li><strong>Process in water bath:</strong> Submerge jars in boiling water, covering tops by 1-2 inches. Start timing once water returns to boil.</li><li><strong>Remove and cool:</strong> Place on towel away from drafts. Listen for popping sounds indicating seal formation.</li></ol><p class="tip">Timing varies by food type and altitude. High altitudes require extended processing times—add 5 minutes for every 1,000 feet above sea level.</p><h3>Pressure Canning</h3><p>Required for low-acid vegetables, meats, and soups (pH above 4.6) to prevent botulism. Follow manufacturer instructions for your specific canner model.</p><ul><li>Maintain recommended PSI (typically 10-15 depending on altitude)</li><li>Process times range from 20 to 90 minutes depending on jar size and contents</li><li>Allow pressure to return to zero naturally before opening</li><li>Cool jars completely before checking seals</li></ul><p class="warning">Incorrect pressure canning can result in botulism, a deadly toxin. Follow tested recipes exactly. Never adjust processing times downward.</p></section><section id="smoking"><h2>Smoking & Cold Smoking</h2><p>Smoking cures and preserves meat through smoke exposure and drying. Two methods exist: hot smoking (cooks and preserves) and cold smoking (preserves without cooking).</p><h3>Hot Smoking</h3><p>Temperature range: 160-180°F. Fish and thin meats cook through in 4-6 hours. Thicker meats require 12+ hours.</p><ol><li>Cure meat with salt (20% of weight) for 24-48 hours</li><li>Rinse thoroughly and air-dry until pellicle forms (tacky surface layer)</li><li>Arrange on racks without touching</li><li>Smoke with hardwoods (hickory, oak, apple, cherry) avoiding softwoods which impart unpleasant flavors</li><li>Meat is done when internal temp reaches 160°F for fish, 165°F for poultry</li><li>Cool completely before storage</li></ol><p class="tip">Pellicle formation is critical—it prevents exterior drying while interior cooks, creating optimal texture and flavor.</p><h3>Cold Smoking</h3><p>Temperature range: 70-85°F. Takes weeks to months but doesn't cook meat. Used for long-term storage of bacon, sausage, and fish.</p><ul><li>Cure heavily with salt (20-25% of weight) for 1-2 weeks</li><li>Rinse and dry until firm to touch</li><li>Smoke at low temperatures for 2-4 weeks</li><li>Hang in cool, well-ventilated space for final aging</li><li>Finish with multiple weeks of aging in salt to ensure preservation</li></ul><p class="warning">Cold smoking does not kill harmful bacteria. Only use with fully cured meats where salt concentration prevents pathogenic growth.</p></section><section id="salting"><h2>Salting & Curing</h2><p>Salt draws moisture from food and inhibits bacterial growth through osmotic pressure and direct antimicrobial action. One of humanity's oldest preservation methods.</p><h3>Dry Salting</h3><p>Rub salt directly onto meat or fish surface. Use kosher or sea salt at 10-20% of meat weight depending on desired final saltiness.</p><ul><li>Layer salt between meat pieces</li><li>Store in cool location (50-60°F ideal)</li><li>Salt-cured bacon, pork belly, ham: 7-14 days</li><li>Salt-cured fish: 2-4 days for thin fillets, 1-2 weeks for whole fish</li><li>Moisture draws out creating brine—this is normal</li><li>Rinse before cooking to reduce salt content</li></ul><h3>Wet Curing (Brining)</h3><p>Submerge food in concentrated salt brine (typically 20% salt solution: 1 cup salt per gallon water).</p><ul><li>Use glass, ceramic, or food-grade plastic containers</li><li>Weigh meat down to keep submerged using plates or specialized weights</li><li>Store in cool location (50-60°F)</li><li>Duration: 5-14 days depending on meat thickness</li><li>Results in saltier final product than dry curing</li><li>Excess moisture must be removed before cooking</li></ul><h3>Equilibrium Curing</h3><p>Most advanced method. Calculate exact salt needed based on meat weight for precise final salt content.</p><p><strong>Calculation:</strong> Salt needed (grams) = Meat weight (grams) × 0.025 (for 2.5% salt content)</p><ul><li>Mix salt thoroughly into meat</li><li>Vacuum seal or wrap tightly</li><li>Refrigerate 1-3 weeks depending on thickness</li><li>No rinsing required—salt has saturated evenly</li></ul><p class="tip">Higher altitudes or dry climates may require slightly increased salt percentages as environmental moisture affects curing dynamics.</p></section><section id="drying"><h2>Drying & Dehydration</h2><p>Removing water prevents microbial growth. Traditional sun-drying works well in hot, dry climates. Fire or smoke-drying creates dual preservation through heat and antimicrobial smoke compounds.</p><h3>Sun Drying</h3><p>Best in regions with low humidity, bright sunlight, and temperatures above 85°F.</p><ul><li>Slice food uniformly (quarter-inch to half-inch thickness)</li><li>Arrange on clean screens or racks with good air circulation</li><li>Place in direct sunlight, bring indoors at night to avoid moisture reabsorption</li><li>Duration: 2-7 days depending on food type and climate</li><li>Food should be brittle or pliable when fully dry—no moisture when bent or torn</li><li>Store in breathable cloth containers to allow air circulation</li></ul><p class="warning">Monitor for insects and mold. Cover with fine mesh to prevent contamination. Discard any pieces showing dark spots or off-odors.</p><h3>Fire-Drying</h3><p>Hang thinly sliced meat, fish, or produce over low, smoky fire (100-120°F ideal). Slow smoking prevents case hardening while ensuring even drying.</p><ul><li>Suspend on racks 3-4 feet above fire</li><li>Maintain gentle smoke—no flames or intense heat</li><li>Duration: 4-10 days depending on size</li><li>Product develops smoky flavor and antimicrobial properties from smoke compounds</li><li>Final product should bend slightly without breaking</li></ul><h3>Oven Drying</h3><p>Use lowest oven setting (140-160°F) with door slightly propped to allow moisture escape.</p><ul><li>Line racks with parchment paper</li><li>Arrange food in single layer without touching</li><li>Duration: 6-24 hours depending on food thickness</li><li>Check periodically to ensure even drying</li><li>Energy-intensive but reliable in humid climates</li></ul><p class="tip">Dried foods rehydrate in hot water or stock. Rehydration liquid contains valuable nutrients—use in cooking rather than discarding.</p><h3>Pemmican: Portable High-Calorie Preservation</h3><p>Pemmican is pure fat and protein—superior to jerky for long-term storage and caloric density. Keeps 5+ years if properly sealed.</p><h4>Pemmican Recipe</h4><ol><li><strong>Prepare meat:</strong> Use lean meat (venison, elk, bison, beef), trim all fat, slice thin, dry completely to jerky consistency (internal temp 160°F before dehydrating)</li><li><strong>Pound meat:</strong> Reduce dried jerky to fine powder using mortar and pestle or grinding stone. Larger chunks spoil faster.</li><li><strong>Render fat:</strong> Use high-quality animal fat (beef tallow, elk fat). Render slowly at low temperature (250°F max), strain through cloth to remove solids</li><li><strong>Combine ratio:</strong> 1 part powdered dried meat to 1 part rendered fat by weight (e.g., 1 pound meat powder to 1 pound melted fat)</li><li><strong>Optional additions:</strong> Dried berries (pemmican + berries = pemmican), wild nuts, or dried fruit (improves flavor, slightly reduces shelf life)</li><li><strong>Mix thoroughly:</strong> Combine warm fat with meat powder, ensure complete coating—any exposed meat leads to spoilage</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> Pack into airtight containers, seal completely with wax to prevent oxidation. Store in cool location (50-60°F).</li><li><strong>Shelf life:</strong> 5+ years in sealed, cool storage. Opened containers should be consumed within weeks as oxygen causes rancidity.</li></ol><h3>Jerky: Shelf-Stable Dried Meat</h3><h4>Safe Jerky Production</h4><ul><li><strong>CRITICAL:</strong> Achieve internal temperature of 160°F BEFORE dehydrating to kill surface bacteria and parasites</li><li><strong>Method:</strong> Slice meat into strips (1/4-inch thickness ideal), heat to 160°F (oven, smoking, or boiling), then dehydrate</li><li><strong>Drying:</strong> Continue drying after heating until moisture content below 10%</li><li><strong>Test doneness:</strong> Bend jerky—should crack slightly but not snap; when torn, interior should show no moisture</li><li><strong>Shelf life:</strong> 4-6 weeks in airtight containers, up to 3-4 months in cool location (50-60°F)</li></ul><h3>Water Activity (aw) & Microbial Safety</h3><p>Water activity is the key to understanding preservation through drying:</p><ul><li><strong>Below 0.85 aw:</strong> Prevents growth of most bacteria (only salt-tolerant species survive)</li><li><strong>Below 0.70 aw:</strong> Prevents mold growth; extremely shelf-stable</li><li><strong>Measurement:</strong> Use water activity meter (expensive) or test empirically—food that cracks when bent is likely below 0.70 aw</li><li><strong>Application:</strong> Dried jerky (0.65-0.75 aw) is stable for months; slightly moister foods (0.75-0.85 aw) require cooler storage</li></ul><h3>Hardtack: Emergency Ration Bread</h3><p>Hardtack is dense, stable bread that lasts years—traditional military ration for expeditions and survival.</p><h4>Hardtack Recipe</h4><ol><li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> 2 cups flour, 1/2 cup water, pinch of salt (1 teaspoon)</li><li><strong>Mix:</strong> Combine ingredients into stiff dough (should be drier than normal bread dough)</li><li><strong>Roll:</strong> Roll thin (1/4-inch thickness) on floured surface</li><li><strong>Cut & prick:</strong> Cut into 2-inch squares, prick densely with fork to prevent puffing and ensure even drying</li><li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place on sheet pan, bake at 350°F for 30 minutes each side (total 60 minutes)</li><li><strong>Cool completely:</strong> Must be bone-dry before storage—any residual moisture causes mold</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> Store in airtight, dry containers in cool location. Lasts 1+ year when properly stored.</li><li><strong>Consumption:</strong> Hardtack is rock-hard; soak in water/broth for 15-30 minutes to soften, or crush and boil into porridge</li></ol><p class="warning">Hard enough to break teeth—soften before eating to prevent dental damage. Traditional sailors nicknamed it "tooth dullers" for good reason.</p></section><section id="fermentation"><h2>Fermentation & Pickling</h2><p>Fermentation uses beneficial bacteria and yeasts to preserve food while creating lactic acid that inhibits pathogens. Pickling uses vinegar for preservation. Both methods create probiotic foods beneficial for digestion.</p><h3>Lacto-Fermentation</h3><p>Vegetables ferment in salt brine where Lactobacillus bacteria naturally present on plants convert sugars to lactic acid.</p><h4>Basic Method</h4><ol><li>Prepare vegetables—cut to uniform size, remove any damaged portions</li><li>Make brine: 5% salt solution (1 tablespoon salt per cup water)</li><li>Pack vegetables tightly in clean glass jars with herbs and spices as desired</li><li>Pour brine over vegetables ensuring complete submersion</li><li>Weight down vegetables using fermentation weights or cabbage leaves</li><li>Cover loosely to allow gas escape while preventing contamination</li><li>Keep at room temperature (60-75°F) away from direct sunlight</li><li>Taste daily starting day 3—fermentation complete when flavor is desired (typically 3-14 days)</li><li>Transfer to cool storage once fermented</li></ol><h4>Fermentation Indicators</h4><ul><li>Cloudy brine is normal—indicates active fermentation</li><li>White mold on surface can be skimmed off if only surface contamination</li><li>Slime or fuzzy mold throughout indicates spoilage—discard</li><li>Bubbles rising indicate healthy bacterial activity</li><li>Strong vinegar smell is normal—intensity increases with time</li></ul><h3>Pickling with Vinegar</h3><p>Vinegar preserves through high acidity (pH below 3.8). Immediate preservation—no fermentation period needed.</p><h4>Quick Pickling</h4><ol><li>Prepare vegetables and pack into hot jars</li><li>Heat vinegar with water, salt, sugar, and spices (basic ratio: 1 part vinegar, 1 part water, 1-2 tablespoons salt, 1-2 tablespoons sugar per quart)</li><li>Pour hot pickling liquid over vegetables leaving 1/2-inch headspace</li><li>Wipe rims, apply lids and rings</li><li>Process in water bath 10-15 minutes</li><li>Allow to cool completely before storing</li></ol><p class="tip">Vinegar type affects flavor—apple cider vinegar creates mild taste, distilled white vinegar is sharper, rice vinegar offers subtle sweetness.</p></section><section id="root-cellar"><h2>Root Cellaring & Cool Storage</h2><p>Proper storage conditions extend fresh food shelf life dramatically without processing. Root cellars maintain 32-50°F with 80-95% humidity—ideal conditions are region-dependent.</p><h3>Traditional Root Cellar</h3><p>Underground spaces naturally maintain cool, stable temperatures. If unavailable, create similar conditions using:</p><ul><li>Basement corners away from furnaces and exterior walls</li><li>Buried insulated boxes or containers</li><li>Sand/soil-insulated storage pits</li><li>Shaded outdoor structures in cool climates</li></ul><h3>Critical Grain Storage: Moisture & Mycotoxins</h3><p class="warning">CRITICAL - LIFE-THREATENING: Grain moisture MUST be below 13% or mycotoxins develop. Aspergillus mold produces aflatoxin (causes liver cancer and immune damage). Improper grain storage is a silent killer that makes stored grain toxic.</p><ul><li><strong>Maximum moisture:</strong> 13% by weight (test with moisture meter for accuracy)</li><li><strong>Storage conditions:</strong> Cool (50-60°F), dry, airtight containers</li><li><strong>Prevent condensation:</strong> Use desiccant packets (silica gel, dried lime) in sealed containers</li><li><strong>Regular inspection:</strong> Check monthly for off-odors (musty = mold growth), insects, or discoloration</li><li><strong>Discard immediately:</strong> Any grain showing visible mold, insect infestation, or musty smell—toxins may be invisible</li></ul><h3>Root Cellar Humidity by Crop (Critical Specificity)</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Food</th><th scope="row">Temperature</th><th scope="row">Humidity</th><th scope="row">Shelf Life</th><th scope="row">Storage Notes</th></tr><tr><td>Potatoes</td><td>40-45°F</td><td>90-95%</td><td>4-9 months</td><td>CRITICAL: 90-95% humidity prevents shriveling; dark location prevents greening and solanine production.

Water bath canning of low-acid foods can result in botulism, a deadly toxin causing paralysis and death. Never guess on processing times or methods—only use tested recipes from USDA or tested sources.</p><p class="warning">MOLD IN PRESERVED FOODS: Discard entire batch if mold appears throughout. Surface mold on fermented foods may be skimmed if only surface contamination and food smells normal, but fuzzy mold throughout indicates spoilage. When in doubt, throw it out.</p><p class="warning">SIGNS OF SPOILAGE: Discard any preserved food showing: fizzing when opened (gas production from fermentation), cloudiness with foul smell (pathogenic contamination), swollen cans/jars (gas production), slimy texture, or unusual color. Trust your senses—off-smells and tastes indicate dangerous contamination.</p><p class="warning">SALT SAFETY: Excess salt intake over long periods can cause health issues. Rinse heavily salted foods before cooking. Fermented foods are safer for high-salt consumption due to probiotic benefits, but moderation is still advised for those with hypertension.</p><p class="warning">ALTITUDE ADJUSTMENTS: Processing times must increase at higher altitudes due to lower boiling points. For every 1,000 feet above sea level, add 5 minutes to water bath canning times. Pressure canning requires PSI adjustment—consult USDA guidelines for your elevation.</p><h3>Testing Seals</h3><p>After 24 hours of cooling, verify canning seal integrity:</p><ul><li>Press center of lid—should not flex or move</li><li>Attempt to lift lid with fingertips—properly sealed lids resist removal</li><li>Listen for distinct "pop" sound during cooling (indicates seal formation)</li><li>Any jar that failed to seal must be refrigerated and consumed within 1-2 weeks, or reprocessed immediately</li></ul><h3>Safe Fermentation Practices</h3><ul><li>Use non-iodized salt (iodine inhibits fermentation)</li><li>Ensure vegetables remain fully submerged—exposed portions develop mold</li><li>Use clean but not sterilized equipment—beneficial bacteria should be present</li><li>Maintain consistent cool temperature (60-75°F)—fluctuations prevent fermentation</li><li>Ferment away from direct sunlight which degrads flavor and color</li><li>If fermentation stops prematurely or has been interrupted, discard the batch</li></ul></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="fod-02-trapping-hunting.html">Trapping & Hunting</a> | <a href="fod-03-agriculture-basics.html">Agriculture Basics</a> | <a href="fod-05-food-foraging.html">Food Foraging</a> | <a href="food-rationing.html">Food Rationing</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
