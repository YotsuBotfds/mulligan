Strength: 60-70% of rope breaking strength. Does not slip under load. Particularly useful when loop must be temporarily fixed, then released easily.</p><p><strong>Tying:</strong> 1) Create loop in standing line; 2) Pass working end through loop; 3) Wrap around standing line; 4) Pass back through loop; 5) Tighten. Memory aid: "Rabbit comes out of hole, around tree, back down hole."</p><h3>Clove Hitch:</h3><p><strong>Use:</strong> Attach rope to cylindrical object (pole, ring). Quick tie, easy to untie. Strength: 60-70%.</p><p><strong>Tying:</strong> 1) Pass rope around pole from right; 2) Cross over standing line; 3) Pass around pole again (opposite direction); 4) Pass under first wrap; 5) Tighten. Second wrap is critical—must cross under first wrap or hitch will slip.</p><h3>Square Knot (Reef Knot):</h3><p><strong>Use:</strong> Bind two ropes of equal diameter together. Fast to tie. Can slip under load; NOT recommended for critical applications. Useful for securing bundles or bandages.</p><p><strong>Tying:</strong> 1) Cross right rope over left; 2) Tie simple knot; 3) Cross left rope over right; 4) Tie second simple knot (opposite hands). Result resembles "x" shape from end view.</p><h3>Figure-Eight Knot:</h3><p><strong>Use:</strong> Stopper knot (prevent rope from slipping through hole). Creates bulge that catches. Strength: 65-75%.</p><p><strong>Tying:</strong> 1) Make figure-eight shape with working end; 2) Cross over, under, over standing line; 3) Pass back through original loop; 4) Tighten. Resembles figure "8" when complete.</p></section><section id="attachment-knots"><h2>Attachment Knots</h2><h3>Taut-Line Hitch (Adjustable Loop):</h3><p><strong>Use:</strong> Create loop that slides when unloaded but jams when under tension. Excellent for tent guy-lines and adjustable loads.</p><p><strong>Tying:</strong> 1) Make three wraps around standing line with working end; 2) Pass through loop from opposite direction as wraps; 3) Tighten wraps; 4) Loop will slide freely but jam under tension.</p><h3>Timber Hitch:</h3><p><strong>Use:</strong> Attach rope to logs or heavy objects for dragging. Quick to tie and untie. Load capacity: excellent for objects 50kg+.</p><p><strong>Tying:</strong> 1) Wrap working end around log 1.5 times; 2) Make wraps around working end with standing line (minimum 3 wraps); 3) Working end jams against log; 4) Hitch tightens under load and releases easily when load removed.</p><h3>Trucker's Hitch (Mechanical Advantage Knot):</h3><p><strong>Use:</strong> Creates 2:1 mechanical advantage for tightening loads without tools. Excellent for securing cargo.</p><p><strong>Tying:</strong> 1) Create small loop (bowline or fixed loop) in standing line at midpoint; 2) Pass working end under fixed anchor point; 3) Pass back up and through loop; 4) Create mechanical advantage by pulling down on working end (requires explanation of physics for full understanding—essentially creates pulley effect with rope).</p></section><section id="bends"><h2>Bends (Joining Ropes)</h2><h3>Sheet Bend (Becket Bend):</h3><p><strong>Use:</strong> Join two ropes of unequal diameter. Forms loop from thicker rope; passes thinner rope through loop. Strength: 50-60%.</p><p><strong>Tying:</strong> 1) Create loop from thicker rope; 2) Pass thinner rope through loop; 3) Wrap around both strands of loop; 4) Pass under and back between loop strands; 5) Tighten.</p><h3>Fisherman's Knot (Double Overhand Bend):</h3><p><strong>Use:</strong> Extremely secure joining of two ropes. Strength: 60-70%. Cannot slip once under load.</p><p><strong>Tying:</strong> 1) Cross two ropes; 2) Tie overhand knot with first rope around second rope; 3) Tie identical overhand knot with second rope around first rope; 4) Pull both standing lines to tighten (creates two interlocked overhand knots).</p><h3>Surgeon's Knot:</h3><p><strong>Use:</strong> Join two ropes quickly; similar to square knot but more secure. Strength: 60%.</p><p><strong>Tying:</strong> 1) Cross right rope over left; 2) Tie double overhand knot (pass working end twice through loop); 3) Cross opposite and tie simple overhand knot; 4) Tighten.</p></section><section id="loops"><h2>Loops & Fixed Points</h2><h3>Butterfly Loop (Alpine Loop):</h3><p><strong>Use:</strong> Create strong fixed loop in middle of rope (no access to ends). Strength: 65-75%. Useful when only midpoint available.</p><p><strong>Tying:</strong> Complex; requires practice. Creates loop by making series of wraps and tucks. Forms figure-eight shape from middle of standing line.</p><h3>Overhand Loop:</h3><p><strong>Use:</strong> Simple fixed loop at rope end. Strength: 50-60%.</p><p><strong>Tying:</strong> Make overhand knot using working end as loop rather than as simple knot. Quick and easy.</p><h3>Running Bowline:</h3><p><strong>Use:</strong> Adjustable loop that slides until desired point, then locks under load.</p><p><strong>Tying:</strong> Tie bowline with loop adjusted to desired size before load application. Loop tightens under tension but maintains position.</p></section><section id="splicing"><h2>Splicing Techniques</h2><p>Splicing joins rope ends permanently by weaving strands together. Creates stronger join than knots (70-90% rope strength retained).</p><h3>Eye Splice (Creating Loop at Rope End):</h3><ol><li>Unlay rope strands for 3-4cm at working end</li><li>Form loop of desired size</li><li>Weave each strand separately: pass over one strand, under next, over next, continuing in sequence</li><li>Complete three passes minimum (five passes for maximum strength)</li><li>Trim excess strands</li><li>Result: permanent loop with strength equivalent to rope breaking strength</li></ol><h3>Short Splice (Joining Two Rope Ends):</h3><ol><li>Unlay both ropes for 5-7cm</li><li>Interlock strands (alternate strands from each rope)</li><li>Tie temporary stopper knots in all strands</li><li>Weave each strand over/under pattern from other rope</li><li>Complete minimum three passes</li><li>Trim strands and seal ends (burn synthetic fiber)</li></ol><h3>Splice Testing:</h3><p>Properly spliced rope fails at standing line, not at splice. If splice pulls apart, technique was inadequate—more passes required.</p></section><section id="mechanical-advantage"><h2>Mechanical Advantage Systems</h2><p>Block and tackle systems (pulleys) provide mechanical advantage for lifting/moving heavy loads with less force.</p><h3>Mechanical Advantage Calculation:</h3><p><strong>Formula:</strong> Mechanical Advantage = Number of rope segments supporting load</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Single fixed pulley = 1:1 (no advantage). Two-pulley movable system = 2:1 (halves required force). Four-pulley system = 4:1 (quarters required force).</p><h3>Simple Pulley Systems:</h3><ul><li><strong>Fixed pulley:</strong> Changes direction only; no mechanical advantage</li><li><strong>Movable pulley:</strong> Provides 2:1 advantage if rope attached to fixed point; load moved half distance of rope pulled</li><li><strong>Compound pulley:</strong> Multiple movable pulleys; advantage multiplies (2x2x2 = 8:1 with three movable pulleys)</li></ul><h3>DIY Pulley Construction:</h3><p>Salvage wheel/axle from machinery or construct from wood: wooden sheave (wheel) 15-20cm diameter, bearing on wood frame. Pulley efficiency 90-95% when properly constructed; metal pulleys 95-98% efficient.</p><h3>Rigging Load Limits:</h3><p>Always use safety factor: design system for 5x maximum expected load. Example: if lifting 100kg load, all components must handle 500kg minimum (rope, knots, pulley, anchor points).</p></section><section id="rigging-applications"><h2>Rigging Applications</h2><h3>Securing Loads on Vehicles/Sleds:</h3><p>Use trucker's hitch with X-cross pattern over load. Secure both front and rear. Creates tension that prevents shifting. Check tension before traveling—vibration may loosen knots; retighten every 2 hours on long journeys.</p><h3>Rescue Systems:</h3><p>Create Z-pulley system for rescue: one pulley at load, one fixed, one at pulling point. Provides 3:1 mechanical advantage. Allows single person to raise 100kg+ loads. Essential for cliff rescue, well extraction, heavy equipment retrieval.</p><h3>Sailing/Rigging:</h3><p>Use bowline for main sheet (sail control line) attach point. Clove hitches for staying rope attachment to mast. Knowledge of proper rigging essential for sailing survival craft.</p><h3>Camp/Shelter Rigging:</h3><p>Use taut-line hitches for tent guy-lines (allows adjustment without retying). Use timber hitch for securing poles. Square knot for bundling gear.</p></section><section id="common-mistakes"><h2>Common Mistakes & Solutions</h2><h3>Mistake 1: Using Square Knot for Critical Applications</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Tying square knot to secure load or join critical cordage. Knot can slip under certain loads, particularly if ropes have unequal diameters or sudden loading occurs.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Reserve square knot for temporary/non-critical uses only. Use bowline, sheet bend, or fisherman's knot for critical applications.</p><h3>Mistake 2: Inadequate Rope Length for Knots</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Tying knots with minimal rope length. Knots slide or fail under load.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Leave minimum 5-10cm working end after knot completion. Long working ends provide safety margin; can be trimmed after knot is proven solid.</p><h3>Mistake 3: Improper Knot Tightening</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Leaving knots partially loose. Knot tightens unevenly under load; some strands bear most tension while others remain slack.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Tighten all components of knot sequentially. Tug working end, then standing line, checking that knot tightens evenly. Properly tied knot is visually compact and symmetric.</p><h3>Mistake 4: Rigging System Overload</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Using pulley system without safety factor. System fails catastrophically when load near rope breaking strength.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Calculate maximum load realistically (including shock loading and unexpected jerks). Design system for 5x that load minimum. Inspect rope and rigging before critical use.</p></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="cra-03-cordage-textiles.html">Cordage Making</a><a href="con-01-shelter-building.html">Shelter Building</a><a href="cra-07-primitive-weapons.html">Primitive Weapons</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
