Simple designs can be constructed from clay, stone, and scrap materials with minimal cost.</p><h3>Ground-Level Forge (Simplest Design):</h3><h4>Components:</h4><ol><li><strong>Firebox:</strong> Circular clay or stone basin 30cm diameter, 20cm deep</li><li><strong>Grate:</strong> Iron bars across bottom for air flow; space 1cm apart</li><li><strong>Air source:</strong> Bellows connected via tuyere (pipe) underneath grate</li><li><strong>Workbench:</strong> Anvil positioned 30cm in front of forge, at chest height (approximately 1m above ground)</li><li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Updraft hood above forge directs smoke away from worker</li></ol><h4>Construction:</h4><p>Dig shallow pit 30cm diameter, 20cm deep. Line bottom and sides with fire clay (clay-sand mixture). Build clay walls to contain fire. Install iron grate to rest on foundation (supports coal). Position bellows outlet (tuyere) 5-10cm above grate floor (allows air distribution). Install hinged hood above pit to direct smoke upward.</p><h3>Coal Fuel Preparation:</h3><p>Quality coal is critical. Use hard coal (bituminous or anthracite), not soft coal or charcoal. Crush coal to 1-2cm chunks. Pre-heat coal in fire before placing steel in forge (coal burns hotter when pre-heated). Cost: 2-5kg coal per hour smithing (expensive but essential for hot working).</p><h3>Temperature Management:</h3><p>Monitor fire temperature by steel color when inserted: black heat (dark red) = 400°C, dark cherry red = 600°C, bright cherry red = 750°C, orange = 900°C, yellow = 1100°C, white = 1200°C+. Working temperature range: cherry red to orange for most smithing.</p><div class="warning"><strong>Safety Warning:</strong> Hot metal looks identical to cold metal from distance. Never touch metal with bare hands; always use tongs or tools. Metal at 600°C causes severe burns in milliseconds.</div></section><section id="tools-equipment"><h2>Essential Tools & Equipment</h2><h3>Primary Smithing Tools:</h3><ul><li><strong>Hammer:</strong> 2-4kg head, wooden handle (absorbs shock). Different faces for specific tasks: flat (general work), cross-peen (drawing), ball-peen (shaping).</li><li><strong>Anvil:</strong> 40-100kg weight ideal. Steel face on iron body. Flat working surface with rounded horn for shaping. Cost prohibitive to fabricate; scavenge from salvage yards.</li><li><strong>Tongs:</strong> Custom-made for specific tasks. Jaw width matches work piece; insulated handles 40cm+ long prevent hand burns.</li><li><strong>Chisels & Punches:</strong> Hardened steel tools for cutting and shaping. Handles secured with wrapping (not set screws).</li><li><strong>Fullers & Swages:</strong> Shaped dies for specific forming operations. Fuller narrows stock; swage rounds/shapes.</li></ul><h3>Bellows Construction:</h3><p>Simple box bellows: two wooden boards (30cm x 40cm) with leather hinges and connecting wood frame. Seal joints with leather gasket. Air output: 50-200 liters per minute depending on pumping rate. Critical for sufficient air flow to achieve working temperatures.</p></section><section id="metal-selection"><h2>Metal Selection & Properties</h2><h3>Iron vs. Steel:</h3><p><strong>Iron:</strong> Pure iron (less than 0.3% carbon). Forges easily, welds simply, but lacks hardness. Suitable for large structural work, hardware. Melting point: 1530°C.</p><p><strong>Steel:</strong> Iron with 0.3-2% carbon. Harder than iron, better for tools. Carbon content increases hardness but reduces malleability. Melting point: 1370-1540°C (varies with carbon content).</p><h3>Steel Classification by Carbon Content:</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Carbon %</th><th scope="row">Type</th><th scope="row">Characteristics</th><th scope="row">Best Uses</th></tr><tr><td>0.3-0.5%</td><td>Low-carbon</td><td>Soft, forges easily, welds well</td><td>General structure, rivets</td></tr><tr><td>0.5-1.0%</td><td>Medium</td><td>Harder than low-carbon, less forgeable</td><td>Tools, weapons, springs</td></tr><tr><td>1.0-1.5%</td><td>High-carbon</td><td>Hard, brittle, difficult to forge</td><td>Cutting tools, dies</td></tr></table><h3>Metal Sources:</h3><ul><li><strong>Salvage:</strong> Old machinery, vehicle parts, structural steel (most accessible)</li><li><strong>Smelted ore:</strong> Requires furnace and fuel (advanced; not practical for survival)</li><li><strong>Trade/purchase:</strong> From suppliers (requires currency/barter goods)</li></ul></section><section id="heating-techniques"><h2>Heating & Temperature Control</h2><h3>Heating Sequence:</h3><ol><li><strong>Pre-heat:</strong> Push metal to edge of coals for 5-10 minutes (allows internal heating)</li><li><strong>Active heat:</strong> Move metal into hottest part of fire; increase bellows speed</li><li><strong>Temperature observation:</strong> Watch color change; remove when bright cherry red (working temperature)</li><li><strong>Work quickly:</strong> Metal cools rapidly (drops 100°C per minute outside fire); complete operation before cooling to dark red</li><li><strong>Reheating:</strong> Return to fire when metal color indicates too-cool condition (dark red or below)</li></ol><h3>Avoiding Overheating:</h3><p>Excessive temperature (white heat) causes grain growth and brittleness. Also increases oxidation loss. Ideal: maintain bright cherry red color during working. If metal turns orange, remove from fire immediately.</p><h3>Coal Efficiency:</h3><p>Minimize air flow (reduce bellows pumping) when metal is removed from fire. Excess air wastes fuel and overheats forge. Optimize bellows speed to maintain working temperature without excessive heat generation.</p></section><section id="basic-techniques"><h2>Basic Smithing Techniques</h2><h3>Drawing Out (Tapering):</h3><p><strong>Objective:</strong> Lengthen metal by reducing cross-section. Strike metal perpendicular to length with flat hammer face. Work progresses: heat, strike 5-10 times, rotate 90°, repeat. Each sequence increases length 5-15%. Maintain consistent hammer tempo.</p><h3>Upsetting (Thickening):</h3><p><strong>Objective:</strong> Shorten and thicken metal. Strike end of rod held vertically on anvil. Heat must be sufficient (bright orange) or metal cracks. Typical application: creating tool heads, reinforcing joints.</p><h3>Bending:</h3><p><strong>Objective:</strong> Change metal direction without reducing cross-section. Heat in fire, place on anvil horn, strike against horn while supporting opposite side. Angle increases with each heat cycle. 90-degree bends typically require 2-3 heats.</p><h3>Twisting:</h3><p><strong>Objective:</strong> Create spiral patterns or increase surface area. Clamp one end in vise, heat long section, grip other end with tongs, rotate tongs slowly while striking metal. Creates visual interest and structural benefit (increased surface area improves adhesion for decorative purposes).</p><h3>Welding:</h3><p><strong>Objective:</strong> Join two pieces of metal into one solid mass. Heat both pieces to white heat (1200°C+). Place end-to-end on anvil; strike forcefully and repeatedly. Metal must be extremely hot to weld (difference of 50°C between too-cool and too-hot is small). Success requires skill; expect 50% success rate initially.</p><div class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Practice welding with scrap iron before attempting critical work. Each failure teaches technique. Joint strength equals parent metal when properly executed.</div></section><section id="tool-making"><h2>Tool Making</h2><h3>Making a Hammer Head:</h3><ol><li>Start with 2-3kg scrap steel bar (5cm x 5cm x 10cm)</li><li>Heat to bright orange (working temperature)</li><li>Use cross-peen hammer to create poll (striking face) on one end: strike perpendicular to length, rotate, strike opposite side, repeat until face is 5cm diameter</li><li>Create eye (hole for handle insertion) by drifting (using tapered punch to stretch hole through metal)</li><li>Shape face to slight dome (improves striking efficiency)</li><li>Grind or sharpen edges if desired</li><li>Attach wooden handle using epoxy or metal wedges</li><li>Test by striking scrap metal; listen for clear ring (indicates good metal)</li></ol><h3>Making a Chisel:</h3><ol><li>Select high-carbon steel rod (1cm diameter, 15-20cm length)</li><li>Heat one end to bright orange</li><li>Draw out to form blade (taper from thick end to thin blade end)</li><li>Create blade edge by flattening and sharpening (30-degree angle)</li><li>Leave thick section for handle attachment</li><li>Harden by heating to orange and quenching in water (makes blade very hard but brittle)</li><li>Temper by reheating to light purple color and cooling slowly (reduces brittleness)</li><li>Attach handle (bone or hardwood) using wrapped fiber or metal wedges</li></ol><h3>Making Nails:</h3><p>Cut length of wire/rod to desired nail length. Forge one end to create point (draw out, sharpen). Upset opposite end to create head. Efficiency: approximately 5 minutes per nail; produces 12 nails per hour. Quality: properly forged nails grip better than cut nails.</p></section><section id="hardware"><h2>Hardware Production</h2><h3>Hinges:</h3><p>Create pintles (pins) and eyes (loops) for doors/cabinets. Simple strap hinge: flatten iron bar, drill holes, shape flaps. For permanent joints, forge eyes around pintles (welding). Strength: properly made iron hinge supports 200+ kg doors.</p><h3>Handles & Brackets:</h3><p>Bend iron rod or bar into required shape. Handle typical dimensions: 15-20cm long, U-shaped or ring-shaped. Bracket shapes vary by application (L-shaped, T-shaped, etc.). Forge mounting holes by drifting (punching).</p><h3>Rivets:</h3><p>Create short studs with enlarged head on one end (upset to form head). Insert through overlapping metal sheets, then peen (spread) opposite end to secure joint. Strength: riveted joints are permanent and strong (stronger than bolted unless bolts are very tight).</p></section><section id="decorative"><h2>Decorative Ironwork</h2><h3>Scrollwork:</h3><p>Create curves by heating iron rod and bending around scrolling form (shaped tool). Typical application: ornamental fence sections, door grilles. Technique: bend slightly, cool to set, repeat with deeper curves until desired spiral achieved.</p><h3>Twisting & Spirals:</h3><p>Heat and rotate rod while holding one end fixed. Creates attractive visual pattern and increases surface area. Practical application: decorative gate elements, handles with visual appeal.</p><h3>Punched Designs:</h3><p>Create patterns by punching holes or striking shaped dies into hot metal. Tool marks are characteristic of handmade ironwork. Designs range from simple geometric (circles, squares) to complex (animal shapes, plant motifs).</p><h3>Surface Finish:</h3><ul><li><strong>Polishing:</strong> Grind with fine stone or sand to remove oxidation and create smooth finish</li><li><strong>Blackening:</strong> Keep iron in coal fire without active bellows; carbon coating prevents rust</li><li><strong>Painting:</strong> Oil-based paint protects from rust and adds color</li></ul></section><section id="common-mistakes"><h2>Common Mistakes & Solutions</h2><h3>Mistake 1: Insufficient Heating</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Attempting to forge at too-low temperature (dark red or below). Metal cracks, shatters, or resists forming. Results in wasted material and dangerous flying pieces.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Wait until bright cherry red or orange before striking heavily. Brief test strike before committing to full power strokes confirms temperature adequacy.</p><h3>Mistake 2: Working Too Slowly</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Removing metal from heat, working briefly, reheating frequently. Excessive heating cycles cause oxidation loss (steel dissolves into scale) and grain growth. Wastes fuel and creates brittle metal.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Plan sequence before heating. Work rapidly once metal reaches temperature. Limit heating cycles to 3-4 per operation.</p><h3>Mistake 3: Overstrike (Poor Hammer Control)</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Continuing to strike after metal has cooled below working temperature. Cold metal does not deform; instead it work-hardens and cracks. Causes tool breakage and wasted material.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Reheat metal when color indicates cooling. Better to reheat frequently than to overstrike. Develop sense for metal cooling rate through experience.</p><h3>Mistake 4: Inadequate Quenching</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Quenching hardened steel too slowly (cooling in air rather than water). Final hardness is insufficient. Tool edge dulls rapidly or chips during use.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Quench in water immediately after heating for hardness. Follow with slow cooling (tempering) to reduce brittleness. Temperature control during these steps is critical.</p></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="con-02-carpentry-woodworking.html">Carpentry & Woodworking</a><a href="cra-03-cordage-textiles.html">Cordage Making</a><a href="bone-tools.html">Bone Tool Making</a><a href="stone-tools.html">Stone Tool Making</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
