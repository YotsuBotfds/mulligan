A microscope costing perhaps $100-200 in salvaged materials can save lives by enabling diagnosis and detection of unseen threats.</p><p>In collapse scenarios where modern medical diagnostics are unavailable, a functioning microscope becomes a critical tool for community health. Combined with basic staining techniques, it can identify malaria, intestinal parasites, typhoid, dysentery, and other infectious diseases that account for countless preventable deaths.</p></section><section id=optical><h2>Optical Principles</h2><h3>Magnification</h3><p><strong>Magnification</strong> is the ratio of image size to object size. A 10x magnification makes something appear 10 times larger.</p><h3>Simple Magnifier</h3><p>A single lens with short focal length acts as a magnifying glass. A 10 cm focal length lens produces about 2.5x magnification when held 10 cm from the eye. Shorter focal length = higher magnification. A 1 cm focal length lens gives 25x magnification.</p><h3>Compound Microscope</h3><p>Two lens systems: the <strong>objective</strong> (near specimen, short focal length, provides primary magnification) and <strong>eyepiece</strong> (where you look, longer focal length, provides secondary magnification). Total magnification = objective magnification × eyepiece magnification.</p><p>Example: 10x objective + 10x eyepiece = 100x total magnification. Standard lab microscopes range from 40x to 1000x.</p><h3>Resolution Limit</h3><p>Magnification alone doesn't show detail. <strong>Resolution</strong> (ability to see two objects as separate) is limited by light wavelength. Best resolution with visible light: approximately 0.2 micrometers (1/5000 mm). This is why bacteria are barely visible at 1000x and require staining to see structure.</p></section><section id=simple><h2>Simple Magnifier Design</h2><h3>Leeuwenhoek-Style Microscope</h3><p>Dutch scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) built microscopes using tiny glass beads as lenses, achieving 200x magnification. Method:</p><ol><li>Fuse a thin glass rod tip in a flame until a sphere forms (glass bead lens)</li><li>Mount the bead in a metal frame with a specimen holder</li><li>Position a tiny drop of water or oil on the specimen</li><li>Hold the bead very close (2-3 mm from eye) and look toward a light source</li><li>Specimen sits on the slide just below the bead</li></ol><p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Simple, no tools required, produces excellent magnification (100-300x). <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Difficult to focus, very limited working distance (hard to keep specimen in view), requires bright light source and good eyes.</p><h3>Salvaged Magnifying Glass Magnifier</h3><ul><li>Obtain a powerful magnifying glass (20x or higher)</li><li>Mount in a wooden or metal frame with adjustable height</li><li>Add a specimen stage with fine-adjustment screw</li><li>Position light source (candle, oil lamp, or mirror redirecting sunlight)</li><li>Result: 15-40x magnification, easier to use than Leeuwenhoek-style</li></ul></section><section id=compound><h2>Compound Microscope Construction</h2><h3>Basic Design</h3><p>A simple compound microscope requires:</p><ul><li><strong>Objective lens:</strong> 5-10 mm focal length. Produces 10-100x magnification. Salvage from camera, binocular, or magnifying lens assemblies.</li><li><strong>Eyepiece lens:</strong> 25-50 mm focal length. Produces 5-15x magnification. Another salvaged lens or magnifying glass.</li><li><strong>Tube:</strong> Metal or rigid plastic tube holding objective and eyepiece separated by tube length (typically 150-160 mm). For simple models, spacing between lenses = objective focal length + eyepiece focal length + 10-20 cm.</li><li><strong>Specimen stage:</strong> Flat platform where slides sit. Horizontal positioning with fine-adjust screws.</li><li><strong>Focus mechanism:</strong> Screw thread to raise/lower the objective or stage, enabling sharp focus. Even a simple rack-and-pinion mechanism works.</li></ul><h3>Tube Length Calculation</h3><p>For a simple two-lens system:</p><ul><li>Objective focal length: 5 mm (assumed 100x when used alone with proper spacing)</li><li>Eyepiece focal length: 30 mm (assumed 8x)</li><li>Tube length (distance between objective and eyepiece): approximately 150 mm</li><li>Total magnification: ~800x (though practical magnification is lower due to optical quality)</li></ul><h3>Magnification Adjustment</h3><p>Different objectives provide different magnifications. Build two or three interchangeable objectives:</p><ul><li>10x objective (longer focal length, lower magnification, larger field of view, easier to focus)</li><li>40x objective (medium)</li><li>100x objective (high magnification, small field of view, difficult to focus)</li></ul><p>Switch objectives by using a rotating turret or simple mount/unmount mechanism.</p></section><section id=illumination><h2>Illumination Systems</h2><h3>Light Source</h3><ul><li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Brightest and easiest. Position mirror to reflect sunlight through specimen.</li><li><strong>Oil lamp or candle:</strong> Sufficient for magnifications up to 200x. Position close to or under the specimen stage.</li><li><strong>Electrical:</strong> If power available, a simple LED bulb (bright white) mounted under stage is ideal.</li></ul><h3>Condenser Lens</h3><p>A lens positioned between light source and specimen that focuses light onto the specimen. Not essential but dramatically improves image contrast and brightness.</p><ul><li>Focal length: 25-50 mm (a simple magnifying glass works)</li><li>Position: 30-50 mm below specimen</li><li>Adjustable height: Position closer for higher magnifications</li></ul><h3>Diaphragm</h3><p>A variable aperture (opening) that controls light intensity. At high magnification, bright light helps see detail. At low magnification, bright light can overwhelm. A simple cardboard disk with holes of varying diameters works.</p><h3>Dark-Field Illumination</h3><p>For viewing translucent organisms (bacteria, protozoa), <strong>dark-field</strong> is excellent: light comes from the side, and specimens appear bright against a dark background.</p><ul><li>Position light source to the side of the specimen (not below)</li><li>Block direct light with a simple obstruction (paper disk below specimen)</li><li>Result: Excellent contrast, even small organisms are visible</li></ul></section><section id=sample><h2>Sample Preparation</h2><h3>Wet Mount</h3><ol><li>Place small drop of water or saline on glass slide</li><li>Add specimen (drop of water containing organisms, or tissue sample)</li><li>Place cover slip (thin glass or plastic sheet) on top at 45 degree angle</li><li>Lower slowly to avoid air bubbles</li><li>Excess liquid wicks away; organism is sandwiched between slides</li></ol><h3>Staining</h3><p>Most microorganisms are nearly transparent and hard to see. Stains add color and contrast:</p><ul><li><strong>Methylene blue:</strong> Stains nuclei and internal structures. Mix 0.3 gram methylene blue in 100 mL water. Add small drop to specimen.</li><li><strong>Iodine:</strong> Stains carbohydrates and polysaccharides. Uses gram's iodine solution.</li><li><strong>Gram stain (advanced):</strong> Differentiates gram-positive from gram-negative bacteria. Requires crystal violet, iodine, alcohol, and safranin. Multi-step procedure.</li><li><strong>Acid-fast stain:</strong> For tuberculosis and related bacteria. Requires special dyes and heating.</li></ul><h3>Simple Staining Protocol</h3><ol><li>Prepare wet mount on slide</li><li>Add small drop of methylene blue stain at edge of cover slip</li><li>Stain draws under cover slip by capillary action</li><li>Excess stain wicks away with paper towel</li><li>View under microscope</li><li>Organisms should appear blue against lighter background</li></ol></section><section id=water><h2>Water Quality Testing</h2><h3>Direct Observation</h3><p>At 100x magnification, you can see:</p><ul><li>Algae (various shapes and colors, move slowly)</li><li>Protozoans (amoebae, ciliates, flagellates; move actively)</li><li>Large bacteria colonies and clumps (individual bacteria invisible, but colonies visible)</li><li>Parasitic cysts (Giardia, Cryptosporidium; round/oval shapes)</li></ul><h3>Giardia Testing</h3><p>Giardia lamblia causes severe diarrhea.
