Bacteria decompose material anaerobically (without oxygen). Clarified liquid flows to drain field. Tank provides 24-48 hour retention time (allows solids to settle). Properly functioning tank removes 30-40% of contaminants.</p><h3>Septic Tank Sizing</h3><p>Size based on number of residents and daily wastewater flow. Typical: 4-6 people = 1000-1200 gallon tank. Rule of thumb: 150 gallons per person per day × 3 days retention = tank size. Undersized tank fails rapidly (solids overflow to drain field). Oversized tank unnecessary (high cost with marginal benefit).</p><h3>Drain Field Design</h3><p>Trenches 2-3 feet deep, 2-3 feet wide, 50+ feet long total (multiple parallel trenches). Lined with sand and gravel. Perforated pipes distribute effluent into trenches. Soil naturally filters remaining contaminants. Bacteria and protozoa trapped by soil. Chemical contaminants absorbed. Process removes 95%+ of pathogens if functioning properly.</p><h3>Drain Field Spacing</h3><p>Minimum 100 feet from water wells. Minimum 50 feet from surface water sources. Locate downhill from drinking water sources. Avoid wet areas, flood zones, rocky sites (prevent proper filtration). Soil percolation test determines suitability: 1 inch drop per hour optimal (faster = risk of poor filtration, slower = system won't drain).</p><h3>System Failure Signs</h3><ul><li>Toilets backing up or draining slowly</li><li>Grass growing greener over drain field (excess nutrients)</li><li>Wet spots or standing water in yard</li><li>Odors near tank or drain field</li><li>Multiple toilets draining at different rates</li></ul><h3>System Maintenance</h3><p>Pump tank every 3-5 years (removes accumulated sludge). Never use septic tank additives (kill beneficial bacteria). Conserve water (reduces system load). Avoid dumping chemicals, grease, non-degradable materials. If system fails, must replace (expensive - proper design prevents failures).</p></section><section id="wetlands"><h2>Constructed Wetlands</h2><p>Artificial wetland systems provide advanced treatment through plant uptake and biological processes.</p><h3>Wetland System Design</h3><p>Wetland consists of shallow basin (1-2 feet deep) filled with substrate (sand, gravel, soil) planted with wetland vegetation (cattails, reeds, bulrushes). Wastewater distributed at one end, collected at other end. Roots and substrate provide large surface area for bacteria and filtering. Completely natural process, no chemicals or electricity required.</p><h3>Treatment Process</h3><p>Sediment settles quickly. Bacteria decompose organic material. Plant roots absorb nitrogen and phosphorus (major water pollutants). Substrate filters suspended solids. Pathogens reduced by competition from beneficial organisms and unfavorable pH. Process highly effective if properly designed and maintained.</p><h3>Capacity and Sizing</h3><p>Wetland requires 2-5 square feet per person (much larger than septic systems but far superior treatment). For 4-person household: 8-20 square feet minimum (roughly 3x4 to 4x5 feet). Larger wetlands allow greater water retention, better treatment.</p><h3>Plant Selection</h3><p>Cattails: most effective, aggressive growers, 4-6 feet tall, excellent nutrient removal. Reeds: similar effectiveness, handle variations better. Bulrushes: good for cooler climates. Native plants preferred (better adapted, self-sustaining). Avoid invasive species.</p><h3>Maintenance</h3><p>Remove accumulated sludge every 5-10 years (less frequent than septic systems). Harvest plants annually (removes nutrients). Monitor water level (maintain 6-12 inches depth). Wetland essentially maintenance-free once established. No chemical inputs needed.</p><h3>Climate Considerations</h3><p>Cold climates: wetlands still function but bacteria slower (system must be larger). Frozen wetlands partially disrupt function but restart in spring. Very cold climates (below -15°C regularly) may require subsurface flow design (pipes under wetland prevent freezing).</p></section><section id="composting"><h2>Composting Toilets</h2><p>Toilets that compost human waste with carbon material (sawdust, peat) into usable compost.</p><h3>Composting Toilet Types</h3><p>Waterless design: no water used, waste falls into composting chamber. Separator designs: separate urine from feces (urine reused, feces composted). Continuous designs: waste composted directly in chamber. Batch designs: full chamber sealed for composting (takes weeks), then starts new chamber.</p><h3>Operation</h3><p>After each use, add carbon material (sawdust, peat moss, leaves) to cover waste. Carbon provides bulking (creates air spaces) and absorbs moisture and odors. Regular stirring (if accessible) accelerates decomposition. Process takes 6-12 months for complete decomposition (depends on design and conditions).</p><h3>Composted Product</h3><p>After complete composting, product resembles dark soil. Does NOT smell. Not suitable for direct food contact (safety concerns despite processing) but excellent for ornamental plants, trees, landscaping. Can be further aged in piles if concerned about pathogen remaining.</p><h3>Advantages</h3><p>No water required (ideal for arid regions, areas without water systems). No septic or drain field (saves space, cost). Nutrients recovered (not lost to environment). Portable (can move if needed). Self-contained (functions independently).</p><h3>Disadvantages</h3><p>Requires user participation (adding carbon, odor management). Less effective with high-moisture waste (diarrhea overwhelms carbon). Ongoing supply of carbon material required. Final product handling questionable for food crops. Requires large chamber volume (space constraints).</p><h3>Maintenance</h3><p>Regular carbon addition (critical). Monitor moisture level (too wet = anaerobic and smelly, too dry = slow decomposition). Manage odors with additional carbon, ventilation fans. Empty/rotate chambers periodically. Final compost removal and disposal.</p></section><section id="greywater"><h2>Greywater Systems</h2><p>Treating and reusing water from sinks, showers, washing machines (greywater) instead of sending to treatment.</p><h3>Greywater Sources and Quality</h3><p>Sinks, showers, washing machines, baths = low-contaminant greywater (suitable for reuse). Toilets = blackwater (NOT greywater, untreatable without advanced systems). Typical greywater contains soap residue, food particles, hair, bacteria. Treatment before reuse removes most contaminants.</p><h3>Simple Greywater Treatment</h3><ol><li>Settling tank: allows solids to settle and be removed (24-hour retention)</li><li>Sand filter: greywater passes through sand, removing particles and bacteria</li><li>Storage tank: treated water stored for irrigation use</li></ol><h3>Reuse Applications</h3><p>Toilet flushing: 2-3 gallons per flush (biggest water use in homes). Landscape irrigation: flowers, shrubs, non-edible plants. Car washing: recirculate multiple times before disposal. Emergency water (after boiling) if needed. Most efficient reuse: toilet flushing.</p><h3>Restrictions</h3><p>Never use untreated greywater for drinking or food crops. Salt and soap in greywater accumulate in soil (damages plants long-term). Bacteria may survive short treatment (especially important for food crops). Best for non-edible ornamental plants and toilet flushing.</p><h3>Greywater Plumbing</h3><p>Separate lines from black water. Direct sink/shower water to greywater tank. Pump or gravity-flow to reuse point. Overflow goes to septic or sewage system. Requires dual plumbing (complex in existing homes, easier in new construction).</p><h3>System Sizing</h3><p>Typical household: 50-100 gallons greywater daily. Landscape irrigation needs: 5-20 gallons daily (depending on climate, vegetation). Excess greywater must go somewhere (overflow, drain field, or storage tank for future use).</p></section><section id="testing"><h2>Effluent Testing</h2><p>Monitoring treatment system effectiveness through water quality testing.</p><h3>Basic Parameters</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Parameter</th><th scope="row">Typical Value</th><th scope="row">Safe Level</th><th scope="row">Indicates</th></tr><tr><td>Suspended Solids (mg/L)</td><td>300+ raw sewage</td><td>Less than 30</td><td>Filtration effectiveness</td></tr><tr><td>BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand)</td><td>100-300 raw sewage</td><td>Less than 20</td><td>Organic content</td></tr><tr><td>Total Nitrogen (mg/L)</td><td>50-70 raw sewage</td><td>Less than 10</td><td>Nutrient removal</td></tr><tr><td>Phosphorus (mg/L)</td><td>5-10 raw sewage</td><td>Less than 1</td><td>Nutrient removal</td></tr></table><h3>Pathogen Testing</h3><p>Fecal coliform count indicates sanitary quality. Raw sewage: 100,000,000+ per 100mL. Safe discharge: less than 200 per 100mL (EPA standard). Simple test strips available for sanitary facilities. Professional lab testing more accurate but expensive.</p><h3>DIY Testing Methods</h3><p>Clarity test: filter sample, compare to clean water (cloudiness indicates solids). Odor test: properly treated effluent has no fecal smell (smell indicates incomplete treatment). Simple coliform test kits available (color change indicates presence). Professional testing more reliable but DIY tests give useful indication.</p><h3>Testing Frequency</h3><p>New system: test monthly first year (detect problems early). Established systems: test quarterly or annually (verify continued function). More frequent testing if problems suspected. Test after heavy rain or heavy use (stresses systems).</p></section><section id="pathogens"><h2>Pathogen Reduction in Sewage Treatment</h2><p>Various treatment processes reduce pathogens to safe levels.</p><h3>Pathogen Types</h3><ul><li><strong>Bacteria:</strong> E. coli, Salmonella, Vibrio. Killed by chlorine, heat, UV, biological competition, or environmental stress (pH extremes, starvation).</li><li><strong>Viruses:</strong> Hepatitis A, Rotavirus, Norovirus. Harder to kill than bacteria. Heat and chlorine effective. Some survive environmental stress.</li><li><strong>Protozoa:</strong> Giardia, Cryptosporidium. Very resistant to chlorine. Killed by boiling, UV, filtration through sand/gravel with adequate particle size.</li><li><strong>Helminths:</strong> Worm parasites. Settled in tanks. Killed by long-term composting, heat, or chlorine.</li></ul><h3>Treatment Mechanisms</h3><p>Settling: heavy particles (including some parasites) settle by gravity. Biological treatment: bacteria consume pathogens (predation and competition). Filtration: particles and pathogens trapped in sand/gravel. pH extremes: acid or alkaline conditions kill some pathogens. Time: pathogens die naturally given sufficient retention time (days to months).</p><h3>Multi-Barrier Approach</h3><p>No single treatment 100% effective. Multiple barriers (settling, filtration, biological treatment) together achieve high confidence. Septic + soil filtration removes 99%+ pathogens. Constructed wetlands similar effectiveness. Boiling or UV disinfection provides final barrier if needed.</p><h3>Reduction Targets</h3><p>For safe environmental discharge: 99% pathogen reduction acceptable. For potable water: 99.99%+ reduction required. For irrigation reuse: 95%+ reduction minimum. Treatment design determines achieved reduction level.</p></section><section id="maintenance"><h2>System Maintenance and Troubleshooting</h2><p>Proper maintenance prevents system failures and extends lifespan.</p><h3>Septic System Maintenance</h3><ul><li>Pump tank every 3-5 years (remove sludge accumulation)</li><li>Monitor water use (excessive water overloads system)</li><li>Avoid flushing non-degradable items (toilet paper OK, but avoid wipes, feminine products, diapers)</li><li>Avoid dumping chemicals (cleaning products, medications, pesticides kill bacteria)</li><li>Protect drain field from compaction (don't park on it, avoid excessive watering)</li><li>Inspect for failures (wet spots, odors, backup)</li></ul><h3>Constructed Wetland Maintenance</h3><ul><li>Harvest plants annually (removes excess nutrients)</li><li>Remove accumulated sludge every 5-10 years</li><li>Monitor water level (maintain shallow water depth)</li><li>Check for standing water or pooling (indicates clogging)</li><li>Prevent erosion at inlets/outlets</li></ul><h3>Composting Toilet Maintenance</h3><ul><li>Add carbon material after each use (critical)</li><li>Monitor moisture level (add dry material if too wet)</li><li>Ventilate if odors develop (increase airflow)</li><li>Empty full chambers for composting</li><li>Rotate to new chamber periodically</li></ul><h3>Common Problems and Solutions</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Problem</th><th scope="row">Cause</th><th scope="row">Solution</th></tr><tr><td>Slow draining toilets</td><td>Tank full or clogged pipes</td><td>Pump tank, check for blockages</td></tr><tr><td>Odors near system</td><td>Tank too full or system failure</td><td>Pump tank immediately, assess system</td></tr><tr><td>Wet spots in yard</td><td>Drain field clogged or flooded</td><td>Reduce water use, check drain field</td></tr><tr><td>Backup into house</td><td>Complete system failure</td><td>Cease water use, pump tank, assess replacement</td></tr></table></section><section><h2>Sewage Treatment System Comparison</h2><table><tr><th scope="row">System</th><th scope="row">Cost</th><th scope="row">Space</th><th scope="row">Treatment Quality</th><th scope="row">Maintenance</th><th scope="row">Best For</th></tr><tr><td>Septic</td><td>$3000-6000</td><td>Large (tank + field)</td><td>85-90%</td><td>Pump every 3-5 years</td><td>Standard rural homes</td></tr><tr><td>Wetland</td><td>$5000-10000</td><td>Very large (2-5 sq ft per person)</td><td>95%+</td><td>Minimal, annual harvest</td><td>Properties with space, aesthetics valued</td></tr><tr><td>Composting</td><td>$1000-3000</td><td>Small (just toilet chamber)</td><td>Excellent for solids</td><td>Regular carbon addition</td><td>Off-grid, water-scarce areas</td></tr><tr><td>Greywater</td><td>$1000-3000</td><td>Medium (storage/filtration)</td><td>70-85%</td><td>Monitor filters, overflow</td><td>Homes with existing systems, landscape irrigation</td></tr></table></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="sur-05-sanitation-hygiene.html">Sanitation and Hygiene</a> | <a href="sur-01-water-purification.html">Water Purification (effluent treatment)</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div><section style='background-color:var(--surface);border-left:4px solid var(--accent2);padding:20px;margin:20px 0;border-radius:4px'><h2>Septic Tank Sizing</h2><p>Septic tank must be sized to household occupancy.
