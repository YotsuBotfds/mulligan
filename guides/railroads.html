A single horse can pull roughly 10 times more weight on rails than on a road due to the low rolling resistance of steel wheels on steel rails. Even simple wooden-railed tramways with horse power represent a major transportation upgrade.</p><p>In collapse scenarios, building rail systems (even small-scale) multiplies the productive capacity of communities. Raw materials can be moved efficiently, specialization becomes practical, and larger communities can connect into trade networks.</p></section><section id="efficiency"><h2>Transportation Efficiency Comparison</h2><table><tr><th scope="row">Mode</th><th scope="row">Typical Load</th><th scope="row">Power Source</th><th scope="row">Cost per Ton-Mile</th><th scope="row">Infrastructure</th></tr><tr><td>Human hand-carry</td><td>50 lbs max</td><td>Labor</td><td>Very high</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Pack animal on road</td><td>200-300 lbs</td><td>Animal</td><td>High</td><td>Basic trail</td></tr><tr><td>Animal on rail</td><td>2-5 tons</td><td>Animal</td><td>Medium</td><td>Track + ties + ballast</td></tr><tr><td>Steam locomotive</td><td>20-100 tons</td><td>Coal/water</td><td>Low</td><td>Engineered track</td></tr><tr><td>Gravity (incline)</td><td>Unlimited</td><td>Gravity</td><td>Very low</td><td>Track + cable/counterweight</td></tr></table></section><section id="gauge"><h2>Gauge Selection</h2><p><strong>Gauge</strong> is the distance between the rails (measured on the inside of the rail heads). Choice affects entire system design.</p><h3>Standard Gauge (1435 mm / 4 ft 8.5 in)</h3><ul><li>Most common worldwide; enables interoperability</li><li>Works well for mixed horse/locomotive operation</li><li>Requires precise engineering and materials</li><li>If salvaging existing rolling stock, standard gauge is likely</li></ul><h3>Narrow Gauge (600-1000 mm)</h3><ul><li>Easier and cheaper to build; less material required</li><li>Better for tight curves and hilly terrain</li><li>Suitable for light industrial, mining, and agriculture</li><li>Limited rolling stock availability (requires custom-built or salvaged narrow-gauge cars)</li><li>Perfect for offline communities with limited manufacturing capability</li></ul><h3>Very Narrow Gauge (<600 mm)</h3><ul><li>Minimal material and land cost</li><li>Suitable for short-distance tramways (mine-to-mill, farm-to-market)</li><li>Tightest curves possible</li><li>Limited load capacity; smaller vehicles needed</li></ul></section><section id="roadbed"><h2>Roadbed Construction</h2><h3>Grading & Preparation</h3><p>The foundation is critical. Poor roadbed causes derailments, track misalignment, and accelerated wear.</p><ul><li><strong>Clearing:</strong> Remove vegetation, rocks, roots. Grade should be firm and compacted.</li><li><strong>Grading:</strong> Establish proper slope for drainage. Optimal grade: 0-2% for heavy transport. Maximum safe grade: 2-3% for steam locomotives, less for horse-drawn. Steeper grades possible for gravity-assist tramways.</li><li><strong>Drainage:</strong> Excavate ditches along both sides. Water-logged roadbed degrades quickly. Ensure water flows away from the track.</li><li><strong>Foundation layer:</strong> 2-4 feet of well-compacted earth or bedrock. Test by driving heavy loaded cart over area; should show no settling.</li></ul><h3>Ballast Layer</h3><p>Ballast is the granular material (crushed rock, gravel, cinder, slag) laid between the roadbed and ties. It provides:</p><ul><li>Drainage (water drains through ballast rather than pooling)</li><li>Support (distributes tie loads across wider area)</li><li>Stability (prevents ties from shifting laterally)</li></ul><p><strong>Ballast depth:</strong> 15-20 cm is standard. Wider ballast beds for curves and heavy-load sections. Inspect and refresh annually; ballast compacts and degrades.</p></section><section id="track"><h2>Track Laying</h2><h3>Ties (Sleepers)</h3><p><strong>Material:</strong> Hardwood ties last longest—oak, locust, cedar, chestnut. Softwood (pine) acceptable but requires treatment. Dimensions: approximately 20 x 15 cm cross-section, 2.4 m long (standard gauge).</p><p><strong>Spacing:</strong> Typically 60 cm apart (center-to-center). Closer spacing for heavy loads or poor ballast. Farther spacing acceptable for light-duty tramways (up to 1 m).</p><p><strong>Durability:</strong> Untreated ties last 3-7 years. Treated with char (light surface burning) or oil-based preservatives: 20-30 years or more. Alternative materials: stone blocks or concrete for permanent installations (greater initial cost but longer life).</p><h3>Rail Installation</h3><ul><li><strong>Rail type:</strong> Steel rail (salvaged or fabricated) is ideal. Angle iron or flat bar spiked to wooden ties works for light-duty tramways. Wooden rails capped with iron strap were historically the first railroads.</li><li><strong>Spiking:</strong> Secure rails to ties with spikes driven at slight angle (away from rail head). Three spikes per tie is standard.</li><li><strong>Joint alignment:</strong> Rails must meet precisely at joints. Fish-plates (metal brackets) bolted across joints provide additional support.</li><li><strong>Gauge verification:</strong> Measure distance between rails frequently during installation. Maintain tolerance of ±1/4 inch.</li><li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Track should be straight except in designed curves. Check with a string line or surveying transit.</li></ul></section><section id="rolling-stock"><h2>Rolling Stock Design</h2><h3>Basic Flatcar</h3><p>The simplest rail vehicle: a wooden platform on wheel-axle sets (trucks). Flanged wheels keep the car on rails.</p><ul><li><strong>Superstructure:</strong> Wooden deck (planks or boards) fastened to wooden or steel frame</li><li><strong>Trucks:</strong> Wheel assemblies under each end. 2-3 wheels per side on small cars, more on large cars. Wheels should be 18-24 inches diameter for animal-drawn cars.</li><li><strong>Flanged wheels:</strong> Wheels must have a flange (lip) on inner edge to prevent derailment. Salvage from industrial equipment or cast new ones.</li><li><strong>Couplers:</strong> Simple hooks or chain couplers allow cars to be pulled in trains</li><li><strong>Brakes:</strong> At minimum, a wooden friction brake (shoe pressed against wheel) operated by hand lever. Essential for controlling descents on grades.</li><li><strong>Load capacity:</strong> Depends on wheel size, bearing quality, and track condition. Start conservatively: 2-3 tons for animal-drawn, up to 20+ tons for gravity-assist or locomotive.</li></ul><h3>Specialized Cars</h3><ul><li><strong>Ore/coal cars:</strong> Dump beds with side hinges for quick unloading</li><li><strong>Flatbed with stakes:</strong> Posts around perimeter for securing bundled goods</li><li><strong>Tank cars:</strong> Sealed cylinders for transporting liquids (water, oil, chemicals)</li><li><strong>Passenger coaches:</strong> Bench seating, weather protection. Simple design: four walls, roof, wheels.</li></ul></section><section id="motive-power"><h2>Motive Power Options</h2><h3>Human Power</h3><ul><li><strong>Use:</strong> Maintenance, short-distance movement, mine/factory operations</li><li><strong>Design:</strong> Push-rails or hand-crank mechanisms. Practical for small cars (1-2 tons).</li><li><strong>Advantage:</strong> No fuel required; always available</li><li><strong>Limitation:</strong> Very limited range and speed (walking pace)</li></ul><h3>Animal Power (Horse/Mule)</h3><ul><li><strong>Use:</strong> Primary transport for early rail systems. Most practical for offline communities.</li><li><strong>Capacity:</strong> One horse can pull 2-5 tons on level rail (vs. 200-300 lbs on road). Team of 4-6 horses: 10-20 tons or more.</li><li><strong>Speed:</strong> Walking pace 3-4 mph, trotting 6-8 mph sustained. Realistic average with load: 5-6 mph.</li><li><strong>Endurance:</strong> 8-10 hours of work per day sustainable</li><li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Familiar technology, self-replicating (breeding), uses local feed, universally available</li><li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Slow, requires care and feeding, limited to daylight operations</li></ul><h3>Steam Locomotive</h3><p>Requires advanced metalworking and engineering. Small 0-4-0 (four wheels, no trailing wheels) locomotives are simplest:</p><ul><li><strong>Boiler:</strong> Horizontal cylinder for steam generation. Requires precision engineering, quality steel, and safety management.</li><li><strong>Firebox:</strong> Combustion chamber burning coal or wood. Must maintain 150-200+ psi steam pressure safely.</li><li><strong>Drive wheels:</strong> Connected to pistons by rods and cranks. 0-4-0 means all four wheels are driving wheels.</li><li><strong>Capacity:</strong> Small locomotive can pull 20-50 tons depending on grade. Larger locomotives: 50-200+ tons.</li><li><strong>Speed:</strong> 10-20 mph typical. Fuel consumption: 15-30 lbs of coal per mile depending on load and gradient.</li><li><strong>Advantages:</strong> High power, all-weather operation, long range</li><li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Extremely complex to build, requires skilled operation, high fuel cost, significant maintenance required, safety hazards</li></ul><h3>Gravity Systems (Inclined Planes)</h3><p>Uses gravity for downhill transport, counterweights or stored energy for uphill:</p><ul><li><strong>Loaded car descends downhill</strong> pulling a cable connected to an uphill empty car</li><li><strong>Friction brake</strong> controls descent speed to a safe level (1-2 mph)</li><li><strong>Practical for:</strong> Mines, quarries, mills on hillsides. Small-scale industrial operations.</li><li><strong>Advantage:</strong> No fuel or animals required; nearly free operation after construction</li><li><strong>Limitation:</strong> Only works where terrain permits grade of 2-8%. Requires strong cable and reliable braking.</li></ul></section><section id="operations"><h2>Operations & Maintenance</h2><h3>Regular Maintenance Schedule</h3><ul><li><strong>Daily:</strong> Visual inspection for damage, broken spikes, misaligned rails, debris on track</li><li><strong>Weekly:</strong> Re-spike any loose rails, clear drainage ditches, lubricate wheel bearings and axles</li><li><strong>Monthly:</strong> Full gauge verification (especially after heavy use or weather), inspect ties for rot, refresh ballast</li><li><strong>Seasonally:</strong> Replace rotted ties, resurface worn rail sections, full track alignment check with transit</li><li><strong>Annually:</strong> Major tie replacement, ballast replacement, comprehensive inspection</li></ul><h3>Safety Protocols</h3><ul><li>Train operator responsible for vehicle and load at all times</li><li>Couplers must be checked before every train</li><li>Descents above 2 mph must use brakes; operator must test brakes before descent</li><li>Speeds above 10 mph are dangerous with early rail systems; discourage unless on very straight, well-maintained track</li><li>Track workers have priority; moving trains must yield or stop</li></ul></section><section id="economics"><h2>Economics of Rail Systems</h2><h3>Initial Cost</h3><p>For 1 km of narrow-gauge (600 mm) horse-drawn tramway:</p><ul><li>Roadbed preparation: 40-80 labor-days</li><li>Track materials (rail, ties, ballast): 500-1000 lbs iron or steel; 500+ wooden ties</li><li>Rolling stock (one flatcar): 200-300 lbs iron, 50-100 labor-hours</li><li>Total initial cost (materials + labor): equivalent to 5-10 horses or 2-3 months of a skilled worker's wages</li></ul><h3>Operating Cost</h3><ul><li>Horse-drawn: ~2 lbs of grain per mile per horse (cost depends on local grain prices)</li><li>Maintenance: ~10-15% of initial cost per year</li><li>Payback period: 1-3 years if system produces regular freight movement</li></ul><h3>Break-Even Analysis</h3><p>A horse-drawn rail system pays for itself when:</p><ul><li>Volume: Moving 5+ tons per day regularly over 1+ km distance</li><li>versus alternative: hiring 15-20 pack animals or hand carriers to move same load</li><li>A system moving 50+ tons/day can pay for itself in weeks</li></ul></section><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Rail systems multiply productive capacity and enable civilization</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
