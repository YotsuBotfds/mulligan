Removing any element extinguishes fire. Heat: temperature sufficient to ignite material. Oxygen: typically 16%+ in air. Fuel: any combustible material. Reducing any component inhibits fire spread.</p><h3>Fire Spread Factors</h3><ul><li><strong>Wind:</strong> Carries embers and flames ahead, accelerates fire. 10 mph wind can double fire spread rate.</li><li><strong>Fuel Type:</strong> Fine materials (grass, twigs) burn faster than large logs. Dead wood burns faster than live wood.</li><li><strong>Moisture:</strong> Wet materials burn slower. High humidity slows fire spread.</li><li><strong>Topography:</strong> Fire spreads uphill faster (heat rises). Valleys channel wind and accelerate fire.</li><li><strong>Temperature:</strong> High ambient temperature accelerates ignition of nearby materials.</li></ul><h3>Flame Characteristics</h3><p>Flame height indicates fire intensity. Small flames (under 1 foot) = moderate intensity. Flames 4-8 feet = high intensity. Flames above 8 feet = extreme intensity - uncontrollable by hand crews. Wind affects flame appearance and direction dramatically - flames lean downwind, embers carry far ahead.</p><h3>Smoke Patterns</h3><p>Smoke behavior indicates air movement and fire strength. Light smoke = low intensity. Heavy, dark smoke = extreme intensity. Smoke column height indicates fire convection - tall columns mean strong updrafts, possible fire-generated winds. Smoke direction indicates wind direction.</p></section><section id="extinguishers"><h2>Fire Extinguisher Types</h2><p>Different extinguisher types suppress different fire classes. Using wrong type can spread fire or injure user.</p><h3>Fire Classes and Extinguisher Ratings</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Fire Class</th><th scope="row">Fuel Type</th><th scope="row">Extinguisher Type</th><th scope="row">Method</th></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>Ordinary (wood, paper, cloth)</td><td>Water, foam, dry powder</td><td>Cool and smother</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>Flammable liquids (oil, gasoline)</td><td>Foam, dry powder, CO2</td><td>Smother, cool surface</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>Electrical fires (energized equipment)</td><td>Dry powder, CO2</td><td>Non-conductive suppression</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>Combustible metals</td><td>Dry powder (special types)</td><td>Smother only</td></tr><tr><td>K</td><td>Cooking oil/grease</td><td>Wet chemical</td><td>Cool and saponify</td></tr></table><h3>Water Extinguishers</h3><p>Most common, cheapest. Effective on Class A fires (wood, paper, cloth). NOT effective on electrical fires or liquid fires (spreads burning liquid). Water cools materials below ignition temperature. Pressurized water cools effectively and penetrates deep into material.</p><h3>Foam Extinguishers</h3><p>Effective on Class A and B fires. Creates blanket over fuel, smothering fire. Foam floats on liquid, preventing re-ignition. Cooling effect additional benefit. More expensive than water but more versatile.</p><h3>Dry Powder Extinguishers</h3><p>Effective on Class B and C fires. Works by interrupting chemical reaction of combustion. Does NOT cool materials well - can reignite if material still hot. Inert powder clogs vision and lungs briefly. Safety goggles recommended. Powder accumulates everywhere - messy.</p><h3>Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Extinguishers</h3><p>Effective on Class B and C fires (electrical, flammable liquids). Does not cool material - must cool separately or reignition occurs. CO2 displaces oxygen, extinguishing fire. Gas evaporates, leaving no residue. Expensive. High-pressure discharge can injure if directed at skin.</p><h3>Wet Chemical Extinguishers</h3><p>Specifically for Class K fires (cooking oils). Creates chemical reaction that cools and saponifies hot oil, preventing reignition. NOT suitable for other fire classes. Primarily for commercial kitchens.</p></section><section id="firebreaks"><h2>Firebreaks and Containment</h2><p>Firebreaks prevent fire spread by removing fuel or creating barriers.</p><h3>Firebreak Construction</h3><p>Firebreak is strip of cleared land, 10-30 feet wide depending on fire intensity expected. Remove all combustible materials: dead vegetation, leaf litter, fallen branches. Expose bare soil. Width of firebreak should equal 2-3x expected flame height.</p><h3>Natural Firebreaks</h3><p>Streams and bodies of water effectively stop fires. Rocky areas with minimal vegetation slow fire. Open meadows without dead fuel allow fire to spread slower. Strategic property placement relative to natural firebreaks aids fire safety.</p><h3>Maintained Firebreaks</h3><p>Keep properties around structures cleared of dead vegetation. Remove tree branches overhanging roofs. Maintain grass short (mowing reduces fire load). Remove dead trees. Space trees to prevent crown-to-crown fire spread (15+ feet between tree crowns).</p><h3>Emergency Firebreak Creation</h3><p>If fire approaching with no prepared firebreak: immediately clear 20+ foot swath of all dead vegetation. Even partial clearing helps. Coordinate with neighbors - multiple cleared areas more effective than single effort.</p></section><section id="structural"><h2>Structural Fire Response</h2><p>Responding to fires in buildings requires rapid, safe action.</p><div class="warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> In structural fires, prioritize personal and others' life safety above all property. Never re-enter building for any reason once evacuated. Structural fires can spread explosively - seconds make difference between safe and fatal.</div><h3>Immediate Response</h3><ol><li>Alert people in building - use alarm or loud calls</li><li>Evacuate immediately - do not stop for belongings</li><li>Feel doors before opening - hot doors indicate fire beyond</li><li>Stay low below smoke (smoke contains fatal gases)</li><li>Go to designated meeting point, account for all people</li><li>Call emergency services (or send runner if no phone)</li></ol><h3>Fire Containment (Trained Personnel Only)</h3><p>Trained firefighters with proper equipment may attempt suppression. Untrained individuals should evacuate. Fire doubles in size every minute if uncontrolled - minutes difference between manageable and catastrophic.</p><h3>Extinguisher Use (Small Fires Only)</h3><p>Use only if: fire small (contained in small area), single source, escape route clear, proper extinguisher type available, personally confident. Technique: approach from windward side, aim at base of flames, use smooth sweeping motion. Keep escape route behind you - never trap yourself.</p><h3>Stop-Drop-Roll (for people)</h3><p>If clothing ignites: stop running, drop to ground, roll to smother flames. Do NOT run - running increases oxygen, makes fire burn hotter. Cover face with hands while rolling. Seek water immediately after rolling to cool skin.</p></section><section id="wildfire"><h2>Wildfire Defense</h2><p>Protecting structures and lives from advancing wildfire requires preparation and decisive action.</p><h3>Pre-Wildfire Preparation</h3><ul><li>Clear 30-100 feet around structures of dead vegetation</li><li>Remove tree branches overhanging roofs</li><li>Use metal or tile roofing (not wood shingles)</li><li>Enclose eaves and vents with metal mesh (prevents ember entry)</li><li>Create defensible space: maintain green vegetation, water regularly</li><li>Keep gutters clear of leaves and debris</li><li>Have evacuation plan and go-bag ready</li></ul><h3>Evacuation Decision</h3><p>Leave immediately when instructed by authorities. Do NOT wait for last minute - traffic jams kill. Take go-bag with essential documents, medications, valuables. Drive toward fire-free areas. If roads blocked, stay with vehicle (if metal-enclosed) - better than exposure.</p><h3>Last-Minute Home Defense</h3><p>If fire imminent and must stay: close all windows and doors, leave lights on (helps firefighters see you're there), close interior doors to create fire compartments, move away from perimeter walls. Fill pools, hot tubs, buckets with water if hose available. Move propane BBQs away from structures.</p><h3>Ember Defense</h3><p>Embers - small burning pieces carried by wind - ignite most homes, not flames. Embers enter through vents, windows, gaps in siding. Close windows, close vents with metal covers, seal gaps in siding. Standing water (pools, ponds) useful for firefighting helicopters and ground crews.</p><h3>Smoke Management</h3><p>Heavy smoke reduces air quality. Stay indoors, close windows, use HEPA filters if available. Wear N95 or P100 masks outdoors. Smoke exposure dangerous for elderly, children, and those with respiratory conditions. Evacuate rather than endure severe smoke.</p></section><section id="water"><h2>Water Supply Systems for Fire Suppression</h2><p>Adequate water supply critical for fire response.</p><h3>Water Source Reliability</h3><p>Municipal water systems may fail during large fires (loss of pressure from high flow demands). Private wells useless if power lost. Maintain independent water storage: tanks, pools, ponds accessible for firefighting. Water should be separate from drinking water supply (contamination from firefighting efforts).</p><h3>Water Storage Tanks</h3><p>Minimum 2,500 gallons recommended for structures. Tank elevated 8-10 feet (gravity provides pressure for hose use). Or use underground tank with pump. Tank sized for reasonable fire suppression (2,500-5,000 gallon capacity typical).</p><h3>Hydrant and Hose Placement</h3><p>Mark water sources clearly - firefighters need immediate access. Gates to water areas hinged to open fully (don't block access). Hoses maintained in good condition. Nozzles included for hose hookup to various sources.</p><h3>Rural Water Systems</h3><p>Ponds and natural water sources valuable if 20+ feet from flammable vegetation. Pump systems allow water to be drawn for firefighting. Stock in supplies: hoses, pumps, fittings. Coordinate with fire agencies on access and usage.</p></section><section id="safety"><h2>Fire Suppression Safety</h2><p>Improper fire suppression efforts injure or kill responders.</p><div class="warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Untrained individuals should NEVER attempt structural fire suppression. Fires kill and injure unprepared people in seconds. Evacuation and calling professionals is the only safe response for untrained people.</div><h3>Heat Dangers</h3><p>Fire generates extreme heat (600-1000°C+). At 60°C, human skin cannot tolerate more than 5 minutes. Protective equipment (bunker gear) essential. Heat causes death rapidly - seconds of exposure to extreme heat causes fatal injuries.</p><h3>Smoke Dangers</h3><p>Smoke contains carbon monoxide (binds to hemoglobin, prevents oxygen transport), cyanide compounds, and particulates. Low oxygen in smoky areas causes unconsciousness. Smoke kills more people than flames. Escape smoke immediately - do not try to suppress fire from within heavy smoke.</p><h3>Structural Collapse Risk</h3><p>Fire weakens structural materials. Collapses kill firefighters and civilians. Structural failure unpredictable. Never remain in burning structures - floor can collapse, walls can fall. Evacuation only safe response.</p><h3>Explosion Risk</h3><p>Pressurized containers in fires explode violently. Propane, paint cans, compressed gases can detonate. Flying debris kills. Stay far from fire sources containing pressurized containers.</p><h3>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</h3><p>Proper firefighting PPE includes: heat-resistant coat and pants, boots, helmet with face shield, gloves, breathing apparatus. Incomplete PPE provides false sense of security - still lethal exposure risks. Only trained personnel with full PPE should attempt any suppression.</p></section><section><h2>Fire Suppression Quick Reference</h2><table><tr><th scope="row">Situation</th><th scope="row">Recommended Action</th><th scope="row">Safety Level</th><th scope="row">Time to Act</th></tr><tr><td>Small contained fire</td><td>Extinguisher if trained</td><td>Low (if small)</td><td>Immediately</td></tr><tr><td>Growing fire</td><td>Evacuate, call services</td><td>High</td><td>Immediately</td></tr><tr><td>Structural fire</td><td>Evacuate completely</td><td>Critical</td><td>Seconds</td></tr><tr><td>Wildfire approaching</td><td>Evacuate if ordered</td><td>Critical</td><td>Minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Smoke present</td><td>Evacuate/go to cleaner air</td><td>High</td><td>Immediately</td></tr></table></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="sur-02-fire-starting.html">Fire Starting (safe fire management)</a> | <a href="search-rescue.html">Search and Rescue (wildfire evacuations)</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
