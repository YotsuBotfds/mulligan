Modern food systems depend on industrial supply chains that are fragile, expensive, and controlled by a shrinking number of corporations. A community that cannot produce its own seeds is permanently vulnerable. </p><h3> The Crisis of Genetic Uniformity </h3><p> Industrial agriculture has narrowed the genetic diversity of crops to dangerous extremes. Of the 7,000 crop species humans have cultivated, only 30 now provide 95% of global calories. Three crops—rice, wheat, and corn—account for 60% of human calorie intake. When your food depends on genetic monoculture, one pathogen or climate anomaly can devastate continental harvests. </p><p> The U.S. potato famine of the 1840s killed 1 million people because the population depended entirely on one variety: the Irish Lumper. Genetic diversity in the seed bank prevents this scenario from repeating. </p><h3> Commercial Seed Supply Will Collapse </h3><p> Commercial seed companies are consolidating at an accelerating rate. Four corporations—Corteva, Bayer, BASF, and ChemChina—control 65% of the global seed market. Supply chains are strained, prices are climbing, and availability is shrinking. If that supply chain fails—whether through economic collapse, war, pandemic, or natural disaster—communities without seed reserves cannot plant. </p><p> Seed companies also frequently discontinue heirloom varieties because they are not profitable. If you wait for a crop you want to be back in stock, it may never be. Once a variety disappears from commercial seed lists and from all saved seeds, it is extinct forever. </p><h3> Heirloom & Open-Pollinated Varieties Breed True </h3><p> Heirloom varieties (typically 50+ years old) and open-pollinated (OP) seeds are genetically stable. Save seed from a 'Brandywine' tomato and the offspring are 'Brandywine'. Save seed from an 'Anasazi' bean and the offspring are 'Anasazi'. This breeding-true property means that a farmer or gardener can maintain a variety indefinitely with zero external inputs—once you have the seed, you are independent. </p><p> This is revolutionary in a fragile world. It means: <ul><li> No dependence on commercial suppliers </li><li> Seeds adapted to your local climate over generations </li><li> Free reproduction of productive varieties </li><li> Genetic diversity within a variety (unlike hybrids) </li></ul></p><h3> One Season Without Saved Seed = Permanent Loss </h3><p> Seed loss happens silently. A gardener skips saving beans one year because they were tired, or seeds were contaminated, or the season was bad. The next year, they buy seed from the company. But if the company has discontinued that variety, or the supply has broken down, or prices have tripled, it is too late. That genetic line is gone forever—not just from that farm, but potentially from human agriculture. </p><p> The only insurance against this loss is redundancy: seeds stored in multiple locations, tested for viability, and refreshed every few years. A personal seed vault combined with a community seed bank creates resilience. </p><h3> The Svalbard Vault Concept at Community Scale </h3><p> The Global Seed Vault in Svalbard, Norway, preserves 1 million seed samples in a frozen mountain bunker. It is backup for the entire species. But a community cannot rely on a distant vault in the Arctic. What if that vault fails? What if shipping breaks down? What if the seeds you need are not there? </p><p> Every community should have its own seed vault: </p><ul><li><strong> Personal vault: </strong> Stored at home, contains varieties adapted to your land and preferences </li><li><strong> Community seed library: </strong> Shared collection that members check out, grow, return with interest (seeds from the harvest) </li><li><strong> Regional backup: </strong> Exchange with other communities to distribute risk geographically </li></ul><p> This creates redundancy at three scales: personal, local, and regional. If one location fails, the genetic wealth is preserved elsewhere. </p><div class="highlight"><strong> Core Principle: </strong> Every household that grows food should save seed from at least one crop. Every community should maintain a shared seed library. Every region should have backup vaults at separate locations. This is the only reliable insurance against agricultural collapse. </div></section><section id="genetics"><h2> Open-Pollinated vs Hybrid vs GMO: Understanding Your Seeds </h2><p> Not all seeds are equal. The type of seed you plant determines whether you can save seed from the harvest—and whether you maintain agricultural independence. </p><h3> Open-Pollinated (OP) Seeds: The Foundation of Food Security </h3><div class="card"><h4> Definition </h4><p> Open-pollinated seeds are fertilized by natural pollination: wind, insects, or self-pollination. The genetics are stable. Save seed from an OP plant and the offspring are essentially identical to the parent (with minor natural variation). </p></div><ul><li><strong> Breeds true: </strong> Offspring match parent plant </li><li><strong> Stable genetics: </strong> Can save seed indefinitely </li><li><strong> Genetic diversity: </strong> Natural variation within the variety builds resilience </li><li><strong> Adapted varieties: </strong> Over generations, your saved seeds adapt to local climate and soil </li><li><strong> Cost: </strong> Higher initial seed cost, but zero cost after year one </li><li><strong> Best for seed saving: </strong> ALWAYS choose OP varieties </li></ul><p> Examples: 'Brandywine' tomato, 'Anasazi' bean, 'Scarlet Nantes' carrot, 'Walla Walla' onion, 'Butternut' squash </p><h3> F1 Hybrid Seeds: The Planned Obsolescence Trap </h3><div class="card"><h4> Definition </h4><p> F1 Hybrids are deliberate crosses between two inbred parent lines, created in a laboratory. The first generation (F1) displays "hybrid vigor"—they grow fast, produce heavily, and are uniform. But they do not breed true. </p></div><ul><li><strong> Does not breed true: </strong> Seed from an F1 hybrid produces a chaotic mix of plants, not the hybrid you planted </li><li><strong> Genetic regression: </strong> F2 plants are often weaker, less productive, and unpredictable </li><li><strong> Requires new seed: </strong> You must buy seed from the company every year </li><li><strong> Planned obsolescence: </strong> This is intentional—the company profits from selling seed annually </li><li><strong> Short-term vigor: </strong> Looks good in year one, but cannot be perpetuated </li><li><strong> Worst for seed saving: </strong> NEVER use for genetic preservation </li></ul><p> Examples: Most of the vegetables sold in big-box stores, commercial tomatoes, most squash varieties in seed catalogs. Many seed packets are labeled "Hybrid" or "F1"—read carefully. </p><div class="warning"><strong> WARNING: </strong> If you save seed from an F1 hybrid expecting to grow the same plant next year, you will be shocked by the results. F2 plants will be weak, variable, and often unusable. Never rely on hybrids for food security. </div><h3> Genetically Modified (GMO) Seeds: Avoid Completely </h3><div class="card"><h4> Definition </h4><p> GMO seeds have had genes inserted from other species (bacteria, fish, animals) using laboratory techniques. The goal is usually herbicide resistance or insect resistance. GMOs are almost always patented. </p></div><ul><li><strong> Often sterile: </strong> Many GMOs are engineered to produce sterile seeds (Terminator technology) </li><li><strong> Patented: </strong> You do not own the seed. Saving or replanting is legally prohibited </li><li><strong> Corporate control: </strong> Forces annual purchase and dependency </li><li><strong> Ecological risk: </strong> Transgenes can escape into wild relatives, contaminating the genetic pool </li><li><strong> Least resilient: </strong> NEVER use for seed saving. ALWAYS avoid </li></ul><p> Major GMO crops: Corn, soybeans, cotton, canola, sugar beets. These are primarily in commercial agriculture, but home gardeners should avoid any seed labeled as GMO or transgenic. </p><div class="warning"><strong> CRITICAL: </strong> For food security and independence, use ONLY open-pollinated and heirloom varieties. Hybrids and GMOs are dead-ends—you cannot propagate them. They are useful for commercial farmers who can buy seed annually, but they are unsuitable for a resilient food system. </div><h3> How to Identify the Type of Seed </h3><table><tr><th scope="row"> Seed Type </th><th scope="row"> What to Look For </th><th scope="row"> Suitable for Seed Saving? </th></tr><tr><td><strong> Open-Pollinated (OP) </strong></td><td> Seed packet says "OP" or "Open-Pollinated"; heirloom varieties; no mention of hybrid </td><td style='color: var(--accent2);'> YES - Essential </td></tr><tr><td><strong> Heirloom </strong></td><td> Variety is 50+ years old; packet says "Heirloom"; usually OP </td><td style='color: var(--accent2);'> YES - Excellent </td></tr><tr><td><strong> F1 Hybrid </strong></td><td> Packet says "Hybrid", "F1", or "F1 Hybrid"; uniform appearance </td><td style='color: var(--accent);'> NO - Do Not Use </td></tr><tr><td><strong> GMO </strong></td><td> Packet says "Genetically Modified", "Transgenic", or "Roundup Ready" </td><td style='color: var(--accent);'> NO - Avoid Completely </td></tr></table><div class="tip"><strong> Pro Tip: </strong> Buy from heirloom seed companies (Seeds of Change, Johnny's Seeds, Baker Creek, Fedco) that specialize in open-pollinated and heirloom varieties. These are explicitly preserved for seed saving. Avoid mainstream agricultural suppliers and big-box stores, which push hybrids. </div></section><section id="crop-families"><h2> Seed Saving Basics by Crop Family </h2><p> Different crop families have different reproductive strategies. Understanding your crop's family determines how you will collect, isolate, and save its seed. </p><h3> Solanaceae (Nightshade Family): Tomato, Pepper, Eggplant </h3><div class="crop-family"><h4> Reproduction & Isolation </h4><ul><li><strong> Pollination: </strong> Self-pollinating (flowers pollinate themselves) </li><li><strong> Cross-contamination risk: </strong> Low; can grow multiple varieties in same garden </li><li><strong> Isolation distance: </strong> None required (they self-pollinate) </li><li><strong> Difficulty: </strong> Easy </li></ul><h4> Seed Saving Process: Tomato </h4><ol><li> Let fruit ripen fully on plant (even past eating ripeness) </li><li> Cut fruit in half and scoop seeds and gel into a container </li><li><strong> Fermentation (critical): </strong> Cover loosely with a cloth. Leave at room temperature for 2-3 days. The gel coat will decompose. You will smell fermentation (slightly unpleasant smell is normal—that is the beneficial fermentation) </li><li> Rinse thoroughly in water until all gel is removed </li><li> Spread on plate or screen to dry </li><li> Dry for 2+ weeks until completely hard </li><li> Store in cool, dry place </li></ol><p><strong> Why fermentation? </strong> The gel coat contains germination inhibitors that prevent seeds from sprouting inside the fruit. Fermentation removes this inhibitor and kills seed-borne diseases. This single step is critical for seed viability. </p><h4> Pepper & Eggplant </h4><p> Same process as tomato: allow full ripeness, scoop seeds, ferment 2-3 days, rinse, dry. Peppers are easier than tomatoes (less gel), eggplants are similar to tomatoes. </p><h4> Seed Yield & Variety </h4><ul><li> One tomato produces 100-300 seeds </li><li> One pepper produces 50-150 seeds </li><li> One eggplant produces 100-400 seeds </li></ul></div><h3> Cucurbitaceae (Gourd Family): Squash, Melon, Cucumber </h3><div class="crop-family"><h4> Reproduction & Isolation </h4><ul><li><strong> Pollination: </strong> Cross-pollinated by insects (bees) </li><li><strong> Cross-contamination risk: </strong> Very high; different varieties will cross and create unusable hybrids </li><li><strong> Isolation distance: </strong> 1/2 mile minimum; 1 mile is safer </li><li><strong> Alternative: </strong> Hand-pollination (removes need for isolation) </li><li><strong> Difficulty: </strong> Moderate to hard </li></ul><h4> Critical Issue: Cross-Pollination </h4><p> Different squash varieties cross very easily. If you grow 'Butternut' and 'Delicata' squash in the same season, pollen from one will pollinate the other. The fruit looks normal (it is the mother plant's genetics), but the seeds inside are hybrids. Next year, you will grow a useless squash that is neither parent. </p><p> Solutions: </p><ol><li><strong> Isolation distance: </strong> Grow only one variety per season, or locate varieties 1/2 mile apart </li><li><strong> Caging: </strong> Build a mesh cage around flowering plants and manually pollinate with a small brush </li><li><strong> Community arrangement: </strong> Coordinate with neighbors—person A grows squash this year, person B grows different squash next year </li></ol><h4> Seed Saving Process: Squash (Butternut, Delicata, etc.) </h4><ol><li> Allow fruit to fully mature on plant (longer than you would eat it) </li><li> For winter squash, leave on vine until stem dies and skin hardens </li><li> Cut fruit and scoop out seeds with pulp </li><li> Rinse seeds thoroughly to remove all flesh (water flotation helps) </li><li> Spread on screen to dry 2+ weeks </li><li> Store in cool, dry place </li></ol><h4> Melon & Cucumber </h4><p> Same process: cross-pollinated, require isolation or hand-pollination, seeds rinse clean, dry completely. Melons are easier (larger seeds), cucumbers are smaller and drying is finicky (they can develop mold). </p><h4> Seed Yield </h4><ul><li> One squash produces 100-300 seeds </li><li> One melon produces 200-400 seeds </li><li> One cucumber produces 100-200 seeds </li></ul></div><h3> Brassicaceae (Cabbage Family): Cabbage, Broccoli, Kale, Cauliflower </h3><div class="crop-family"><h4> Reproduction & Isolation </h4><ul><li><strong> Pollination: </strong> Cross-pollinated by insects </li><li><strong> Cross-contamination risk: </strong> High; different brassicas can cross (cabbage × broccoli hybrids are possible) </li><li><strong> Isolation distance: </strong> 1 mile minimum between different brassica varieties </li><li><strong> Growth pattern: </strong> Biennial (takes two years) </li><li><strong> Difficulty: </strong> Hard (requires space and patience) </li></ul><h4> The Biennial Challenge </h4><p> Cabbage, broccoli, and kale do not produce seed in their first year. In year one, they store energy in the head (cabbage), florets (broccoli), or leaves (kale). To produce seed, the plant must survive winter and be planted again in spring (year two). This requires: </p><ul><li> Space to overwinter the parent plants </li><li> Climate that does not kill them (mild winter or cold storage with protective covering) </li><li> Ability to protect plants from pests </li><li> Patience for 18+ months from seed to seed </li></ul><h4> Seed Saving Process: Cabbage </h4><ol><li> Year 1: Grow cabbage normally to mature head size. Do not harvest </li><li> Winter: Protect plant from frost (cold frame, mulch, or move to cool storage at 32-40°F if climate is too harsh) </li><li> Spring (Year 2): Plant survives winter. Warm weather triggers bolting (flower stalk emergence) </li><li> Summer (Year 2): Yellow flowers appear. Insects pollinate. Seed pods form </li><li> Late Summer (Year 2): Pods dry on plant and turn brown </li><li> Harvest: Cut flower stalks when mostly dry. Hang in cool place to finish drying. Thresh pods to release seeds </li></ol><h4> Broccoli & Kale </h4><p> Same two-year cycle: grow first year for head/leaves, overwinter, bolt in spring of year two, produce seeds by summer. Isolation distance is 1 mile (brassicas cross promiscuously). </p><h4> Seed Yield </h4><ul><li> One cabbage plant produces 3,000-10,000 seeds </li><li> One broccoli plant produces 5,000-10,000 seeds </li><li> One kale plant produces 5,000-10,000 seeds </li></ul></div><h3> Fabaceae (Legume Family): Bean, Pea </h3><div class="crop-family"><h4> Reproduction & Isolation </h4><ul><li><strong> Pollination: </strong> Self-pollinating (mostly) </li><li><strong> Cross-contamination risk: </strong> Very low; minimal crossing between varieties </li><li><strong> Isolation distance: </strong> None required (rare crossing) </li><li><strong> Growth pattern: </strong> Annual (one year) </li><li><strong> Difficulty: </strong> Very easy </li></ul><h4> Why Beans Are Ideal for Beginners </h4><p> Beans are self-pollinating and require no isolation. You can grow a dozen bean varieties in the same garden and they will not cross. The seed saving process is simple: let pods dry on the plant, thresh, and store. This is why beans are the first crop to save seed from. </p><h4> Seed Saving Process: Dry Bean </h4><ol><li> Allow pods to stay on plant until mature (pods turn brown/papery) </li><li> Pick pods when mostly dry (not soaking wet) </li><li> Shell pods: squeeze or crack open to remove beans </li><li> Dry further on screen (1-2 weeks) if any moisture remains </li><li> Test for dryness: bean should not dent when bent (should snap cleanly) </li><li> Store in cool, dry place </li></ol><h4> Fresh/Snap Beans </h4><p> If you want fresh snap beans, harvest pods when young and tender for eating. For seed, let beans mature fully and pods dry on plant. The mature seeds are not edible (too hard), but they are viable for planting. </p><h4> Peas </h4><p> Same process: grow, let pods mature and dry, shell, store. Peas are equally easy for seed saving. </p><h4> Seed Yield </h4><ul><li> One bean plant produces 20-50 dry beans </li><li> One pea plant produces 10-30 dry peas </li></ul></div><h3> Poaceae (Grass Family): Corn, Wheat, Rice </h3><div class="crop-family"><h4> Reproduction & Isolation </h4><ul><li><strong> Pollination: </strong> Wind-pollinated (pollen drifts on air) </li><li><strong> Cross-contamination risk: </strong> Very high; different corn varieties cross easily over long distances </li><li><strong> Isolation distance: </strong> 1 mile minimum (many recommend 2+ miles) </li><li><strong> Genetic diversity: </strong> Requires 200+ plants minimum for genetic health </li><li><strong> Difficulty: </strong> Hard (requires space and isolation) </li></ul><h4> Why Corn Is Complex </h4><p> Corn is wind-pollinated and crosses at distance. Different corn varieties will cross, and you cannot control where pollen goes. Additionally, corn requires large populations (200+ plants) to maintain genetic diversity. This is intensive for home gardeners but essential for breeding true varieties. </p><h4> Seed Saving Process: Corn </h4><ol><li> Grow 200+ corn plants (minimum for genetic diversity) </li><li> Isolate from other corn varieties by 1 mile (or 2 miles if possible) </li><li> Allow ears to fully mature on plant (kernels harden) </li><li> Harvest ears when stalks brown and kernels are hard </li><li> Remove husks and allow ears to dry further in cool, dry place (2-4 weeks) </li><li> Thresh: Remove kernels from cob (rub ear against cob or use hand thresher) </li><li> Winnow: Pass kernels through air to remove chaff </li><li> Store in cool, dry place </li></ol><h4> Wheat & Rice </h4><p> Wheat is self-pollinating (not wind-pollinated as commonly believed) and requires no isolation. Rice is self-pollinating. Both are annuals and follow similar dry-seed process: mature, harvest, thresh, winnow, store. </p><h4> Seed Yield </h4><ul><li> One corn ear produces 300-400 kernels </li><li> 200 wheat plants produce 5+ lbs of seed </li><li> Rice is similar to wheat in yield </li></ul></div><h3> Alliums (Onion/Garlic Family): Onion, Leek, Garlic, Shallot </h3><div class="crop-family"><h4> Reproduction & Isolation </h4><ul><li><strong> Pollination: </strong> Cross-pollinated (insects) </li><li><strong> Isolation distance: </strong> 1 mile between onion varieties (leek and onion can cross) </li><li><strong> Growth pattern: </strong> Biennial (two years) </li><li><strong> Garlic special case: </strong> Propagated from cloves, not seed </li><li><strong> Difficulty: </strong> Moderate </li></ul><h4> Onion & Leek </h4><p> Onions and leeks follow the biennial pattern: year one grows the bulb, year two produces seed. Let bulbs overwinter, warm spring triggers bolting. Flowers produce seeds. Dry, thresh, store. </p><h4> Garlic: Clove Propagation </h4><p> Garlic is almost always propagated from cloves (vegetative propagation), not seed. This means: </p><ul><li> Save the largest, healthiest cloves from each bulb </li><li> Store cloves in cool place over winter (50-60°F) </li><li> Plant cloves in fall (6-8 weeks before ground freezes) </li><li> Cloves produce genetically identical plants (clone, not hybrid) </li><li> Garlic seed takes longer and is less reliable, so avoid </li></ul><h4> Seed Yield </h4><ul><li> One onion flower stalk produces 1,000+ seeds </li><li> One leek plant produces 500-1,000 seeds </li><li> Garlic produces no seed; clove propagation only </li></ul></div><h3> Apiaceae (Parsley/Carrot Family): Carrot, Parsley, Dill, Cilantro </h3><div class="crop-family"><h4> Reproduction & Isolation </h4><ul><li><strong> Pollination: </strong> Cross-pollinated (insects) </li><li><strong> Isolation distance: </strong> 1 mile between carrot varieties (wild carrot can cross, complicating seed saving) </li><li><strong> Growth pattern: </strong> Biennial (two years for carrot and parsley; annual for dill and cilantro) </li><li><strong> Challenge: </strong> Tiny seeds, difficult to separate from debris </li><li><strong> Difficulty: </strong> Hard </li></ul><h4> Carrot & Parsley (Biennial) </h4><ol><li> Year 1: Grow root (carrot) or leaves (parsley) normally, do not harvest </li><li> Winter: Protect or store at 32-40°F </li><li> Spring (Year 2): Warm weather triggers bolting. Flower umbels (umbrella-shaped clusters) appear </li><li> Summer (Year 2): Flowers produce seeds </li><li> Harvest: Cut umbels when mostly brown/dry. Hang upside down to dry further. Seeds fall out. Winnow to remove chaff </li></ol><h4> Dill & Cilantro (Annual) </h4><p> These bolt in first year. Let plants mature, seeds dry on plant, collect seeds. Much easier than biennials. </p><h4> Seed Yield </h4><ul><li> One carrot plant produces 2,000-5,000 seeds (very small, hard to clean) </li><li> One parsley plant produces 2,000-3,000 seeds </li><li> One dill plant produces 500-1,000 seeds </li></ul></div><div class="highlight"><strong> Summary Table: Seed Saving Difficulty by Crop Family </strong><table><tr><th scope="row"> Family </th><th scope="row"> Crops </th><th scope="row"> Pollination </th><th scope="row"> Isolation Needed? </th><th scope="row"> Years to Seed </th><th scope="row"> Difficulty </th></tr><tr><td> Solanaceae </td><td> Tomato, Pepper, Eggplant </td><td> Self </td><td> No </td><td> 1 </td><td style='color: var(--accent2);'> Easy </td></tr><tr><td> Fabaceae </td><td> Bean, Pea </td><td> Self </td><td> No </td><td> 1 </td><td style='color: var(--accent2);'> Easy </td></tr><tr><td> Poaceae </td><td> Wheat, Rice, Dill, Cilantro </td><td> Self </td><td> No </td><td> 1 </td><td style='color: var(--accent2);'> Easy </td></tr><tr><td> Cucurbitaceae </td><td> Squash, Melon, Cucumber </td><td> Cross (Insect) </td><td> Yes (1/2 mi) </td><td> 1 </td><td style='color: var(--accent);'> Moderate </td></tr><tr><td> Alliums </td><td> Onion, Garlic, Leek </td><td> Cross (Insect) </td><td> Yes (1 mi) </td><td> 2 </td><td style='color: var(--accent);'> Moderate </td></tr><tr><td> Brassicaceae </td><td> Cabbage, Broccoli, Kale </td><td> Cross (Insect) </td><td> Yes (1 mi) </td><td> 2 </td><td style='color: var(--accent);'> Hard </td></tr><tr><td> Poaceae </td><td> Corn </td><td> Cross (Wind) </td><td> Yes (1 mi) </td><td> 1 </td><td style='color: var(--accent);'> Hard </td></tr><tr><td> Apiaceae </td><td> Carrot, Parsley </td><td> Cross (Insect) </td><td> Yes (1 mi) </td><td> 2 </td><td style='color: var(--accent);'> Hard </td></tr></table></div></section><section id="harvesting"><h2> Harvesting Seed: Timing & Method </h2><p> Seeds are mature before fruit is ripe for eating. A ripe tomato you would pick and eat has immature seeds inside. To collect viable seed, you must let fruit mature past eating ripeness. This is the first lesson of seed saving: patience. </p><h3> Dry Seeds: Mature on Plant </h3><p> Dry seeds (beans, corn, squash, brassicas, alliums) should remain on the plant until dry. This reduces moisture content naturally and prepares seeds for storage. </p><div class="step"><strong> Process: </strong><ol><li> Do not harvest fruit/pod when it looks ripe for eating </li><li> Leave on plant for additional 2-4 weeks (varies by crop) </li><li> Pods, husks, or flower structures should brown and dry </li><li> Seeds should feel hard and not easily dent with fingernail </li><li> Pods should rattle when shaken (seeds loose inside) </li><li> Pick fruit when dry but before it falls to ground (rain/rot risk) </li></ol></div><h4> Signs of Readiness: </h4><ul><li> Bean pods: brown, papery, rattle inside </li><li> Corn ears: kernels hard, husk brown, stalk dying </li><li> Squash: skin hard (cannot dent with fingernail), stem brown </li><li> Brassica flower stalks: pods brown, dried completely </li><li> Onion/garlic: leaves brown and wilting, bulbs hard </li></ul><div class="warning"><strong> Timing Risk: </strong> Waiting too long can mean seed falls to ground and is lost.

Cleaning removes this debris and discards weak/empty seeds. Clean seed stores better and germinates more reliably. </p><h3> Winnowing: Separating Seed from Chaff </h3><p> Winnowing uses air to blow away light chaff while heavy seeds fall. This is the oldest and simplest method. </p><div class="step"><strong> Method: </strong><ol><li> Pour seeds and chaff from one container to another in gentle breeze (outdoors, open window, or fan) </li><li> Chaff (light) blows away downwind </li><li> Seeds (heavy) fall into container below </li><li> Repeat 3-5 times until chaff is minimal </li></ol><p><strong> Gentle breeze is key: </strong> Too much wind and seeds blow away. Too little and chaff does not move. An outdoor breeze or small fan works well. </p></div><h3> Screening: Size Separation </h3><p> Screening uses mesh of different sizes to separate seeds by size and remove smaller debris. </p><div class="step"><strong> Method: </strong><ol><li> Use first screen with larger holes than seeds (removes large debris) </li><li> Use second screen with holes smaller than seeds (seeds stay on top, fine debris falls through) </li><li> Shake gently, moving in circular motion </li><li> Inspect seeds: discard cracked, shriveled, or obviously non-viable seeds </li></ol><p><strong> DIY screens: </strong> Layer cheesecloth or window screen in wooden frames. Mesh size depends on seed size. </p></div><h3> Water Flotation: Density-Based Separation </h3><p> Good, viable seeds are denser than empty hulls. Water flotation sorts them by floating away the bad seeds. </p><div class="step"><strong> Method: </strong><ol><li> Pour seeds into container of clean water </li><li> Stir gently, let settle for 1 minute </li><li> Empty/shriveled seeds float, viable seeds sink </li><li> Skim floating seeds and debris from surface </li><li> Pour off floating seeds (discard) </li><li> Drain sinking seeds through strainer </li><li> Spread on screen to dry immediately </li></ol><p><strong> Critical: </strong> Dry thoroughly after water flotation (within hours) to prevent mold. </p></div><h3> Threshing: Releasing Seeds from Pods </h3><p> Threshing separates seeds from pods, husks, or flower structures. </p><div class="step"><strong> Methods: </strong><ul><li><strong> Hand: </strong> Rub pods between palms over cloth. Seeds fall out, pods stay </li><li><strong> Mortar & Pestle: </strong> Gently pound dried pods (not seeds). Do not crush seeds </li><li><strong> Flail: </strong> Bundle dried plant material and beat with stick over cloth </li><li><strong> Bag method: </strong> Place dried material in burlap bag, stomp or beat to release seeds </li></ul><p><strong> Gentle is important: </strong> Goal is to release seeds, not crush them. </p></div><h3> Removing Mold & Contamination </h3><p> If seeds were wet or stored improperly, mold or rot can develop. </p><ul><li><strong> Surface mold: </strong> Brush off gently with soft cloth or old toothbrush </li><li><strong> Heavy mold: </strong> Discard seeds (internally contaminated) </li><li><strong> Insect contamination: </strong> Freeze seeds for 48 hours at -10°F or lower to kill insects and larvae </li></ul><div class="warning"><strong> Cleanliness: </strong> Mold can develop quickly on damp seeds. Never store wet seeds. Clean all containers before storing. Store only fully dry seeds. </div></section><section id="drying"><h2> Drying Seeds: The Critical Step for Long Storage </h2><p> Moisture is the enemy of seed storage. Seeds above 12% moisture content deteriorate rapidly, lose viability, develop mold, and rot. Dry seeds below 8% moisture can remain viable for years. Drying is not optional—it is essential for long-term seed viability. </p><h3> Why Drying Matters </h3><ul><li><strong> Viability: </strong> Each 1% increase in moisture reduces storage life by 50% at room temperature </li><li><strong> Mold prevention: </strong> Moisture triggers fungal growth </li><li><strong> Insect resistance: </strong> Low moisture kills many insect pests </li><li><strong> Long-term storage: </strong> Dry seeds can last 3-10+ years; wet seeds fail in months </li></ul><h3> Method 1: Air Drying on Screens </h3><p> This is the simplest method for most seeds. </p><div class="step"><strong> Process: </strong><ol><li> Spread seeds in single layer on screen or cloth </li><li> Place in warm, dry location (65-75°F ideal, below 40% humidity) </li><li> Ensure air circulation (fan or open window) </li><li> Stir seeds daily (prevents packing) </li><li> Dry for 1-2 weeks, longer for large seeds or humid climates </li><li> Test: seed should snap cleanly when bent (not flex or bend) </li></ol><p><strong> Ideal location: </strong> Attic, basement, dry shed, or room with dehumidifier. </p></div><h3> Method 2: Silica Gel Drying (Faster, More Reliable) </h3><p> Silica gel is a desiccant (moisture absorber) that can dry seeds rapidly and reliably. </p><div class="step"><strong> Process: </strong><ol><li> Place layer of silica gel in bottom of airtight container </li><li> Place seeds in single layer on cloth above gel (not touching) </li><li> Cover container (but leave slightly ajar for first 24 hours) </li><li> Seal tightly after 24 hours </li><li> Check daily: silica gel will change color (blue → pink/clear) as it absorbs moisture </li><li> When gel is saturated, remove seeds and refresh gel </li><li> Replace gel with fresh (or regenerate by heating in oven at 250°F for 1-2 hours) </li><li> Continue process for 5-7 days until seeds are fully dry </li></ol><p><strong> Reusable: </strong> Silica gel can be regenerated and reused indefinitely. </p></div><h3> Method 3: Rice Bran or Flour Drying (Budget Alternative) </h3><p> Powdered rice or flour can act as a desiccant in a pinch (less effective than silica gel but free). </p><div class="step"><strong> Process: </strong><ol><li> Lay seeds on cloth in airtight container </li><li> Sprinkle rice flour or rice bran over seeds (do not mix directly) </li><li> Seal container </li><li> Check daily; refresh flour/bran every 2-3 days </li><li> Takes longer than silica gel but works </li></ol><p><strong> Drawback: </strong> Flour can cake and clump. Silica gel is superior if available. </p></div><h3> Testing for Dryness: The Bend Test </h3><p> Do not guess. Test seeds to confirm they are dry enough for storage. </p><div class="step"><strong> Method: </strong><ol><li> Take a seed and hold it between thumb and forefinger </li><li> Bend with force (not gentle) </li><li><strong> Dry: </strong> Seed snaps cleanly and cracks open </li><li><strong> Too wet: </strong> Seed bends and flexes without breaking </li><li> Test 10-20 seeds from different locations in batch </li><li> All should snap, not bend </li></ol></div><h3> Drying Timeline by Seed Type </h3><table><tr><th scope="row"> Seed Type </th><th scope="row"> Size </th><th scope="row"> Air Dry Time (Ideal Conditions) </th><th scope="row"> Silica Gel Time </th></tr><tr><td> Tomato, Pepper, Eggplant </td><td> Small </td><td> 7-10 days </td><td> 3-5 days </td></tr><tr><td> Bean, Pea </td><td> Large </td><td> 10-14 days </td><td> 5-7 days </td></tr><tr><td> Squash, Cucumber, Melon </td><td> Medium </td><td> 10-14 days </td><td> 5-7 days </td></tr><tr><td> Corn </td><td> Large </td><td> 14-21 days </td><td> 7-10 days </td></tr><tr><td> Tiny seeds (carrot, parsley) </td><td> Micro </td><td> 7-10 days </td><td> 3-5 days </td></tr></table><div class="tip"><strong> Pro Strategy: </strong> Air dry for initial drying (removes obvious moisture), then finish with silica gel (ensures deep dryness).
