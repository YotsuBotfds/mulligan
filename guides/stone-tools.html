Hard but brittle stones create sharp edges; dense stones maintain edges longer.</p><h3>Optimal Stone Materials:</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Stone Type</th><th scope="row">Characteristics</th><th scope="row">Best Uses</th></tr><tr><td>Flint</td><td>Very hard, sharp edge, brittle</td><td>Cutting, flaking (tool making)</td></tr><tr><td>Obsidian</td><td>Extremely sharp, volcanic glass, very brittle</td><td>Fine cutting, surgical applications</td></tr><tr><td>Chert</td><td>Hard, grainy, less sharp than flint</td><td>General cutting, multipurpose tools</td></tr><tr><td>Basalt</td><td>Dense, heavy, durable edge</td><td>Pounding, grinding, heavy tools</td></tr><tr><td>Granite</td><td>Coarse, grainy, durable</td><td>Grinding, abrading, hammerstones</td></tr><tr><td>Sandstone</td><td>Soft, abrasive, good surface</td><td>Sharpening stone, grinding</td></tr></table><h3>Finding Stone:</h3><p>Riverbed sources provide accessible material (water-worn rocks). Exposed cliffs/outcrops offer raw material (requires quarrying). Examine stone for internal flaws (weak planes of cleavage increase fracturing risk).</p><h3>Quality Assessment:</h3><p>Strike test: gently strike stone with hammer; clean sharp sound indicates good material. Dull thud suggests poor material (usually due to internal flaws). Visual inspection: uniform color and no cracks indicate quality stone.</p></section><section id="flintknapping"><h2>Flintknapping Fundamentals</h2><p>Flintknapping is controlled stone flaking to create sharp edges. Requires understanding of physics: angle, force, and material properties.</p><h3>Core & Flake Concepts:</h3><p><strong>Core:</strong> Original stone from which flakes are struck. Used as tool or further worked.</p><p><strong>Flake:</strong> Fragment removed from core. Naturally sharp along edge (where flake separated from core).</p><p><strong>Bulb of percussion:</strong> Distinctive bulge on flake where hammer force was applied. Indicates force direction and efficiency.</p><h3>Flaking Angle:</h3><p>Optimal flaking occurs at 60-80 degree angle between hammer and edge. Too shallow angle (less than 45 degrees): stone crumbles rather than flaking. Too steep angle (greater than 85 degrees): stone crushes instead of breaking cleanly.</p><h3>Force Application:</h3><p>Controlled blow (not power blow) most effective. Hammer force transmitted through stone; excessive force creates uncontrolled fractures. Experienced flintknappers achieve results with light precision taps.</p></section><section id="percussion"><h2>Percussion Flaking Technique</h2><p>Using hammer stone to strike flakes from core. Most straightforward flaking method; useful for beginners.</p><h3>Setup:</h3><ol><li><strong>Prepare workspace:</strong> Sit on ground with legs extended; core rests on left leg (anchor point)</li><li><strong>Secure core:</strong> Hand position on core prevents jumping (reduces unintended flakes)</li><li><strong>Hammer ready:</strong> Hold hammer stone in right hand; weight 1-2 pounds</li><li><strong>Identify edge:</strong> Select ridgeline on core where flakes will separate cleanly</li></ol><h3>Striking Sequence:</h3><ol><li>Position hammer perpendicular to desired edge</li><li>Identify precise strike point (small platform on core edge)</li><li>Strike firmly but not violently (light tap often more effective than full-force blow)</li><li>Observe flake removal direction</li><li>Reposition for next strike (select new platform for next flake)</li><li>Continue until edge is sufficiently sharp or core is exhausted</li></ol><h3>Flake Quality:</h3><p>Ideal flakes have clean edge, small bulb of percussion, and no crushing damage. Poorly struck flakes have crushed striking platform or uncontrolled fractures. Experienced knappers achieve 80%+ quality flakes; beginners expect 30-50% success rate.</p></section><section id="pressure"><h2>Pressure Flaking</h2><p>Using bone or wood point to apply directed pressure (rather than impact) to flake small, precise flakes. Advanced technique producing fine edges.</p><h3>Pressure Flaking Method:</h3><ol><li>Hold core securely; identify edge to work</li><li>Position bone/wood point against edge at 45-60 degree angle</li><li>Apply steady pressure (not quick jab) until small flake pops off</li><li>Adjust angle slightly for next flake</li><li>Continue until desired edge achieved</li></ol><h3>Advantages vs. Percussion:</h3><ul><li>Much finer control (can create precise edge geometry)</li><li>Smaller flakes (less material loss)</li><li>Sharper final edge (pressure flaking produces micro-serrations)</li><li>Slower (individual flakes removed carefully vs. larger percussion flakes)</li></ul><h3>Pressure Flaking Tools:</h3><p>Bone (especially antler) preferred material. Hardwood adequate but less durable. Tools must be strong (pressure flaking places high stress on flaking tool—bone tools break if weak). Fine point (2-3mm) directs pressure precisely.</p></section><section id="grinding"><h2>Grinding & Polishing</h2><p>Grinding creates tools by wearing away stone (vs. flaking which breaks stone). Produces duller but more durable edges.</p><h3>Grinding Process:</h3><ol><li><strong>Select grinding stone:</strong> Rough surface (sandstone, granite) works best</li><li><strong>Secure core:</strong> Hold stone firmly against grinding surface</li><li><strong>Grinding motion:</strong> Circular or back-and-forth motion removes material gradually</li><li><strong>Observe progress:</strong> Material wears slowly (patience essential)</li><li><strong>Final polish:</strong> Fine stone (smaller grain) produces smoother surface</li></ol><h3>Tool Applications:</h3><p>Grinding produces axes, adzes, and grinding stones. Labor-intensive but creates tools usable on wet materials (unlike flaked tools). Grinding stones last years with regular use; flaked tools often break after single use.</p><h3>Time Investment:</h3><p>Flaked tool: 5-30 minutes production time. Grinding axes: 20-40 hours production time. Grinding appropriate only for tools requiring durability (axes for splitting wood, used repeatedly). Flaking appropriate for single-use tools (hunting spear points).</p></section><section id="edge-types"><h2>Edge Types & Applications</h2><table><tr><th scope="row">Edge Type</th><th scope="row">Sharpness</th><th scope="row">Durability</th><th scope="row">Best Use</th></tr><tr><td>Razor sharp (flaked)</td><td>Excellent</td><td>Poor (breaks easily)</td><td>Precise cutting, surgery</td></tr><tr><td>Very sharp (pressure flaked)</td><td>Very Good</td><td>Fair (micro-chips)</td><td>Meat cutting, fine work</td></tr><tr><td>Sharp (percussion flaked)</td><td>Good</td><td>Good (larger chips)</td><td>General cutting, butchering</td></tr><tr><td>Dull (ground)</td><td>Fair</td><td>Excellent (wears gradually)</td><td>Repetitive work (chopping)</td></tr></table><h3>Edge Maintenance:</h3><p>Flaked edges dull quickly (10-20 minutes active cutting). Pressure-flaked edges last 1-3 hours. Ground edges last days of moderate use. Resharpening requires re-flaking (flaked tools) or regrinding (ground tools). Experienced users routinely refresh tools during work day.</p></section><section id="tool-making"><h2>Specific Tool Making</h2><h3>Hand Axe (Chopper):</h3><p>Fundamental tool: pointed or blunt head on short handle. Hand axe: core worked to create two cutting edges meeting at point (bifacial). Flaked around edges by percussion; refined by pressure flaking. Final tool: 4-6 inches long, 2-3 inches wide, weighing 1-2 pounds.</p><h3>Cutting Tool (Knife):</h3><p>Thin flake with one sharp edge. Naturally sharp (sharper than most metal knives). Single-use tool: breaks with hard impact. Best for precise cutting (meat, plant matter). Hafting handle optional (increases control).</p><h3>Grinding Stone (Mortar & Pestle):</h3><p>Grinding tool: base stone with depression (mortar). Pestle: rounded stone pressed into mortar rotating to grind seeds/grains. Mortar created by patient grinding over 1-2 hours. Base stone typically 8-10 inches diameter, 3-4 inches thick.</p><h3>Scraper:</h3><p>Flaked tool with one blunt edge. Used for scraping hide, processing plant material. Less sharp than cutting tool but more durable. Blunt edge prevents cutting too deeply (control more important than sharpness).</p><h3>Fire Stone (Spark Strike):</h3><p>High-carbon iron stone (steel) or flint. Struck against striking stone to produce sparks. Requires practice to direct sparks into tinder. Survival-critical for fire making without matches.</p></section><section id="hafting"><h2>Hafting Stone Tools</h3><h3>Hafting Methods:</h3><ol><li><strong>Direct hafting:</strong> Stone tool bound directly to wooden handle using sinew wrapping</li><li><strong>Socket hafting:</strong> Wooden handle has socket (hole) receiving tapered stone tool; binding secures fit</li><li><strong>Split-handle hafting:</strong> Wooden handle split; stone tool inserted into split; binding holds tight</li></ol><h3>Process:</h3><ol><li>Prepare sinew (or plant fiber) binding material</li><li>Apply bone glue to tool/handle junction</li><li>Wrap binding around junction 10-20 times</li><li>Space wraps evenly (overlapping increases strength)</li><li>Allow glue to dry completely (12-24 hours) before use</li><li>Test by striking tool head (should not move)</li></ol><h3>Tool Angles:</h3><p>Cutting tools slightly angled (5-10 degrees) from handle (improves cutting action). Pounding tools square to handle (maximizes force transfer). Angling accomplished by angling binding or shaping handle.</p></section><section id="common-mistakes"><h2>Common Mistakes & Solutions</h2><h3>Mistake 1: Wrong Flaking Angle</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Flaking at angle less than 45 degrees or greater than 85 degrees. Stone crushes or crumbles rather than producing clean flakes.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Practice on scrap stone. Develop feel for optimal angle (60-75 degrees). Angle too shallow: reposition before striking. Angle too steep: same correction.</p><h3>Mistake 2: Excessive Force</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Striking hard believing strength produces better results. Creates uncontrolled fractures, destroyed tools, and lost material.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use light, controlled taps. Precise hammer placement more important than force. Experienced knappers use minimal force (feather-light touches).</p><h3>Mistake 3: Poor Material Selection</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Attempting to knap unsuitable stone (granite, quartzite). Material resists flaking; effort yields poor results.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Test-strike stone before committing labor. Flint/chert/obsidian preferred. Other stones usable if quality verified.</p><h3>Mistake 4: Inadequate Hafting</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Insufficient binding or glue. Tool head loosens during use; dangerous tool failure.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Wrap minimum 15 times; allow full drying (24 hours). Test hafting before field use. High-quality animal glue essential.</p></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="bone-tools.html">Bone Tool Making</a><a href="con-02-carpentry-woodworking.html">Carpentry & Woodworking</a><a href="cra-07-primitive-weapons.html">Primitive Weapons</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
