Modern baseplate compass combines bearing reference with map overlay for precise navigation.</p><h3>Compass Components</h3><svg viewbox='0 0 500 500' xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label='Navigation and Mapmaking diagram 1'><rect width="500" height="500" fill="#1a2e1a"></rect><defs><radialgradient id="compassFace" cx="50%" cy="50%" r="50%"><stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#f5f0e8;stop-opacity:1"></stop><stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#d4a574;stop-opacity:1"></stop></radialgradient></defs><circle cx="250" cy="250" r="150" fill="url(#compassFace)" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="3"></circle><text x="250" y="130" text-anchor="middle" fill="#1a2e1a" font-size="24" font-weight="bold">N</text><text x="370" y="260" text-anchor="middle" fill="#1a2e1a" font-size="20">E</text><text x="250" y="390" text-anchor="middle" fill="#1a2e1a" font-size="20">S</text><text x="130" y="260" text-anchor="middle" fill="#1a2e1a" font-size="20">W</text><circle cx="250" cy="250" r="10" fill="#1a2e1a"></circle><line x1="250" y1="250" x2="250" y2="100" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="3"></line><text x="280" y="180" fill="#1a2e1a" font-size="12">Magnetic Needle</text><circle cx="250" cy="250" r="140" fill="none" stroke="#1a2e1a" stroke-width="1"></circle><text x="250" y="475" text-anchor="middle" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="11">Degrees: N=0°, E=90°, S=180°, W=270°</text></svg><h3>Compass Components and Functions</h3><ul><li><strong>Magnetic Needle:</strong> Red (north) and white/black (south) ends. Always points toward magnetic north (not true north). Moves freely when compass is level.</li><li><strong>Orienting Lines:</strong> Parallel lines on compass housing align with map grid lines. Used for map orientation.</li><li><strong>Baseplate:</strong> Flat surface with ruler edge for measuring map distances and aligning with map.</li><li><strong>Degree Markings:</strong> 0-360 degree scale around compass housing. 0/360°=North, 90°=East, 180°=South, 270°=West.</li><li><strong>Directional Index:</strong> Reference line pointing out from compass used for bearing determination.</li></ul><h3>Taking a Bearing</h3><ol><li>Place compass on map with edge connecting starting point to destination</li><li>Rotate compass housing until orienting lines align with map grid lines</li><li>Read bearing at directional index (typically 0-360 degrees)</li><li>Rotate compass housing to align orienting arrow with orienting lines for calibration</li><li>Hold compass level, rotate body until magnetic needle aligns with orienting arrow</li><li>Walk in direction compass baseplate edge points</li></ol><h3>Correcting for Declination</h3><p>Magnetic north and true north are different (up to 20 degrees variation depending on location). Most maps include declination information showing correction needed. If declination is 10 degrees east, add 10 degrees to map bearing. If west, subtract. Some modern compasses have adjustable declination setting.</p><h3>Compass Limitations</h3><p>Metal objects (knives, guns, vehicles) throw off compass accuracy. Large metal deposits underground affect readings. Check compass 10+ feet from metal objects. Compass cannot navigate if magnetic north is obscured. Requires clear understanding of map for effective use.</p></section><section id="stars"><h2>Star Navigation</h2><p>Stars provide reliable directional reference without tools. Visible nearly everywhere except equatorial regions with extreme light pollution.</p><h3>North Star (Polaris) Navigation</h3><p>In Northern Hemisphere, Polaris (North Star) directly indicates true north. Located above horizon at latitude (example: at 40°N latitude, Polaris is 40° above horizon). Finding Polaris: locate Big Dipper, follow pointer stars (outer edge of dipper cup) approximately 5 dipper-lengths to bright star = Polaris.</p><h3>Southern Hemisphere Navigation</h3><p>Southern Cross (Crux) constellation indicates south direction. Four bright stars form small cross. Extend longer cross axis 4.5 times to find point directly above south. This method less precise than Polaris but adequate for general direction.</p><h3>Star Arc Navigation</h3><p>Stars arc across sky from east to west. Rising stars come from east, setting stars go to west. If lost, watch star movement: stars moving toward your left hand point south, toward right hand point north. Method works in both hemispheres.</p><h3>Constellations by Season</h3><p>Different constellations visible in different seasons. Orion visible winter, Scorpius visible summer. Learning constellation positions helps identify location and time of year. Navigational stars unchanged over human timescales - method works wherever recorded.</p><h3>Accuracy</h3><p>Star navigation accurate to within 5-10 degrees under good conditions. Clear sky required. Light pollution makes stars harder to see. Most useful for determining general direction rather than precise bearing.</p></section><section id="sun"><h2>Sun Navigation</h2><p>Sun rises in east, sets in west everywhere on Earth. More accurate methods allow precise direction finding.</p><h3>Sun Direction by Time</h3><p>If watch accurate, point hour hand toward sun. Midpoint between hour hand and 12 o'clock = south (Northern Hemisphere). In Southern Hemisphere, 12 o'clock points toward sun, midpoint between 12 and hour hand = north.</p><h3>Shadow Stick Method</h3><p>Place straight stick vertically in ground. Mark tip shadow position with stone. Wait 15 minutes, mark new shadow position. Line between stones runs east-west (first position = west, second = east). Works best near equator. Less accurate near poles where sun tracks nearly horizontally.</p><h3>Sun Arc Observation</h3><p>Sun rises south of due east in summer (Northern Hemisphere), north of due east in winter. Rises due east during spring/fall equinoxes. Observers in tropics experience seasonal northward/southward sun movement. This variation helps estimate month and refine direction.</p><h3>Seasonal Accuracy</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Season (Northern)</th><th scope="row">Sunrise Direction</th><th scope="row">Sunset Direction</th></tr><tr><td>Winter</td><td>Southeast</td><td>Southwest</td></tr><tr><td>Spring</td><td>Due East</td><td>Due West</td></tr><tr><td>Summer</td><td>Northeast</td><td>Northwest</td></tr><tr><td>Fall</td><td>Due East</td><td>Due West</td></tr></table><h3>Sun Navigation Accuracy</h3><p>Accurate to within 15-20 degrees under good conditions. Requires clear horizon. Useful for confirming other navigational methods or general direction finding. Less precise than compass or stars but works during day when stars invisible.</p></section><section id="maps"><h2>Map Reading</h2><p>Understanding map features enables precise navigation and location identification.</p><h3>Map Symbols and Features</h3><p>Maps use standardized symbols: blue lines = water, brown lines = contours (elevation), black lines = roads, green = vegetation/forest, white = open areas. Map legend explains specific symbols. Contour lines show elevation - closer lines = steeper terrain. V-shaped contours point uphill in valleys.</p><h3>Scale Understanding</h3><p>Map scale shows distance representation (example: 1:50,000 means 1 unit on map = 50,000 units on ground). Metric maps: 1cm on map = distance shown (example: 1cm = 500m). Determine distance by measuring with string or compass baseplate ruler, then using scale. Longer distances covered by adding multiple scale distances.</p><h3>Grid and Coordinates</h3><p>Latitude and longitude provide precise location identification. Latitude measures north-south (0° at equator, 90° at poles). Longitude measures east-west (0° at prime meridian, 180° east and west). Many maps use UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) grid for local precision. Grid lines typically shown as square grid on map.</p><h3>Contour Interpretation</h3><ul><li>Closed contours = hilltop or summit</li><li>V-shaped contours pointing uphill = stream valley</li><li>Widely spaced contours = gentle terrain</li><li>Closely spaced contours = steep terrain</li><li>Contour interval shown on map (example: every 100 feet of elevation change)</li></ul><h3>Map Orientation</h3><p>North typically points up on maps. Orienting map with compass ensures features align with landmarks. Place compass on map, rotate map until compass needle aligns with north arrow on map = map oriented correctly. Terrain features should now align with visible landscape.</p></section><section id="deadreckoning"><h2>Dead Reckoning</h2><p>Calculating position by tracking movement direction and distance from last known location.</p><h3>Basic Dead Reckoning</h3><ol><li>Establish starting point on map (known location)</li><li>Determine direction of travel (by compass, sun, or other method)</li><li>Estimate or measure distance traveled (by pace counting, time elapsed, terrain assessment)</li><li>Plot new position on map based on direction and distance</li></ol><h3>Pace Counting</h3><p>Each person has consistent pace length (distance per step). Determine personal pace: measure 100 meters, count steps needed. Divide 100 by step count = pace length in meters. Examples: typical adult pace 0.7-0.9 meters. On difficult terrain or uphill, pace shortens. Count pace every 100 meters (10 paces at 10 meters each). Multiply paces by pace length = distance traveled.</p><h3>Accumulating Error</h3><p>Dead reckoning accumulates error over distance: 1% error typical on flat terrain (1 mile error per 100 miles traveled). Terrain difficulties increase error to 3-5%. Frequent position checks with landmarks minimize error. Adjust course when landmarks visible.</p><h3>Dead Reckoning Accuracy</h3><p>More accurate when: moving in straight line, terrain relatively flat, frequent position checks. Less accurate when: rugged terrain causes path deviation, darkness prevents visual checks, weather obscures landmarks. Best used in combination with other methods rather than sole navigation.</p></section><section id="terrain"><h2>Terrain Association</h2><p>Using visible landmarks to confirm location and navigate without constant map consultation.</p><h3>Landmark Recognition</h3><p>Identify prominent features visible from current location: mountain peaks, ridge lines, buildings, radio towers. For each landmark, determine position on map. Intersection of landmarks confirms current location (triangulation). Multiple landmark confirmations reduce error significantly.</p><h3>Terrain Matching</h3><p>Match visible terrain features with map contours: valleys, ridges, plateaus. Do terrain features visible ahead match map expectations? If yes, navigation on track. If no, reassess location - navigational error likely. Terrain association provides continuous confirmation of position.</p><h3>Stream Following</h3><p>Streams visible on map aid navigation. Following downstream generally leads to lower elevation and human habitation. On map, trace stream to larger streams/rivers. Provides natural highways in difficult terrain. May add distance but reduces navigation complexity.</p><h3>Ridge and Valley Lines</h3><p>High terrain ridges and valleys provide natural routes. Maps show these clearly through contour patterns. Following terrain features reduces navigation error - features rarely allow wandering off course. Requires good terrain observation skills.</p></section><section id="gps"><h2>GPS Alternatives</h2><p>When GPS unavailable or unreliable, alternative methods provide position confirmation.</p><h3>Navigation Without GPS</h3><p>Combination of compass, map, and terrain association provides highly accurate navigation without GPS. More reliable than GPS alone in dense forest or valleys where signal blocked. GPS most useful for recording coordinates, not primary navigation.</p><h3>Position Marking</h3><p>Without GPS, mark positions by: photographing surrounding landmarks and documenting compass direction/distance to prominent features. Create sketch map of local area with distances marked. Later reference helps retrace steps or confirm position to rescuers.</p><h3>Staying Found</h3><p>Primary survival navigation strategy: stay found. Rather than trying to navigate to distant location, stay put and wait for rescue. Stationary location easier to search than moving target. Use visible markers (bright clothing, signal fires, ground-to-air signals) to aid searchers.</p><h3>Navigation Backup Systems</h3><p>Carry compass even if GPS available. Multiple maps of area. Written directions and landmarks documented. Multiple navigation methods provide redundancy - if one fails, others work. Overconfidence in single system leads to failure.</p></section><section id="mapmaking"><h2>Mapmaking Basics</h2><p>Creating maps from observation helps establish local knowledge and communicate location.</p><h3>Map Creation Approach</h3><ol><li>Establish base with cardinal directions marked (use compass or sun)</li><li>Identify prominent landmarks and mark on map</li><li>Estimate distances using pace counting or travel time</li><li>Mark water sources with relevant notes</li><li>Indicate hazards (cliffs, swamps, dangerous animals)</li><li>Show known camp locations or travel routes</li><li>Include time to travel between locations</li></ol><h3>Scale Creation</h3><p>Define personal pace length (from pace counting above). State on map: "1 pace = X meters". Or use natural units: "distance to river = 500 paces". Readers can translate to own paces. Alternatively, use hand-spans: width of closed fist = personal measurement standard. State on map for reference.</p><h3>Terrain Representation</h3><p>Show elevation changes: steeper areas marked with closer parallel lines, gentle slopes with wider spacing. Or use simple symbols: triangles = peaks, curves = valleys. Clearly mark water flow direction (downstream). Include north arrow and scale.</p><h3>Map Detail Level</h3><p>Start simple: basic landmarks, water sources, known camp locations. Add detail as exploration expands knowledge. Color coding helps: blue = water, green = forest, tan = open areas, red = hazards. Legends explain all symbols used.</p><h3>Map Uses</h3><p>Local maps aid rescue operations (share with rescuers). Help groups coordinate movements. Valuable for relocating camps or resources. Establish territorial knowledge. Can be traded for information about distant areas.</p></section><section><h2>Navigation Methods Comparison</h2><table><tr><th scope="row">Method</th><th scope="row">Accuracy</th><th scope="row">Requirements</th><th scope="row">Best Uses</th><th scope="row">Limitations</th></tr><tr><td>Compass</td><td>5-10°</td><td>Compass, map</td><td>Precise bearing, any weather</td><td>Metal interference, needs map</td></tr><tr><td>Stars</td><td>5-10°</td><td>Clear sky</td><td>Confirms direction, night navigation</td><td>Cloudy weather, light pollution</td></tr><tr><td>Sun</td><td>15-20°</td><td>Watch or sun shadow</td><td>Daytime direction, backup method</td><td>Seasonal variation, accuracy limits</td></tr><tr><td>Terrain Association</td><td>50-100m</td><td>Map, observation</td><td>Continuous position check</td><td>Similar terrain causes confusion</td></tr><tr><td>Dead Reckoning</td><td>1-3% error</td><td>Compass, pace counting</td><td>Open terrain, distance tracking</td><td>Error accumulation, terrain difficulty</td></tr></table></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="search-rescue.html">Search and Rescue (using navigation)</a> | <a href="sur-02-fire-starting.html">Fire Starting (signaling for rescue)</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
