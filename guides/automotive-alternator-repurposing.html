Stator coils (3 phase, 12-18 coils) wound on iron core. Rotor with two claw poles and electromagnet winding driven by engine pulley. Diodes convert 3-phase AC to DC: positive output 13.5-14.5V at engine idle, 14.5-15.5V at normal running. Internal regulator limits output to protect battery and electrical system.</p><h3>Typical Ratings</h3><p>Small alternator (compact car): 55-70 amps at 14V = 770-980 watts continuous. Mid-size vehicle: 80-100 amps = 1120-1400 watts. Large truck: 120-150 amps = 1680-2100 watts. Output increases linearly with RPM: 55A at 1000 RPM, 70A at 5000 RPM typical. Larger rotor iron creates stronger magnetic field (higher output), increased RPM capability requires stronger bearings.</p><h3>Brushes & Slip Rings</h3><p>Carbon brushes deliver current to rotor electromagnet through slip rings. Two brushes provide +12V and ground to rotor coil. As alternator spins, rotating magnetic field induces AC in stator, diode bridge converts to DC on output terminal. Brush wear common in high-hour applications (wear rate accelerates with heat). Replacement brushes inexpensive ($20-50), but removal requires opening alternator case.</p></section><section id=motor-conversion><h2>Converting to Motor Operation</h2><h3>Brushless Motor Application</h3><p>Alternator brushless operation: external electronic commutation replaces internal brush commutation. Drive with 3-phase AC power (from frequency inverter or 3-phase supply). Permanent-magnet alternators ideal for this: rotor PM field eliminates need for brush-commutated current. Winding frequency must match power supply frequency (50 Hz or 60 Hz).</p><h3>Brush Motor Alternative</h3><p>Connect alternator as DC motor: supply positive to output terminal (not regulator), ground to case. Rotor electromagnet energized by brushes, creating magnetic field. Stator pole magnets repel rotor, causing rotation. Motor torque proportional to brush current. Starting torque high (10-20 Nm typical). Maximum safe motor speed: 8000-10000 RPM (internal bearing limit). Beyond that, centrifugal force on rotor can cause mechanical failure.</p><h3>Load & Mechanical Protection</h3><p>Motor requires mechanical load (fan, pump, generator). Running unloaded causes excessive current and rapid bearing wear. Load-coupled alternator develops friction torque, limiting current draw. Overspeeding causes rotor deformation (centrifugal force), bearing seizure, internal short. Install mechanical speed limiter or electronic PWM control limiting voltage/current to safe limits.</p><h3>Cooling & Thermal Limits</h3><p>Automotive alternators cooled by engine coolant circulation or forced air from engine compartment airflow. Operating as motor without engine coolant requires external cooling: forced air fan or liquid cooling loop. Thermal runaway: as motor heats, winding resistance increases, drawing more current, generating more heat, until insulation fails. Monitor temperature: uninsulated alternator case typically 40-50°C safe upper limit.</p></section><section id=generator-conversion><h2>Converting to Generator Operation</h2><h3>Direct Generator Use</h3><p>Alternator already optimized as generator: spin rotor mechanically (water wheel, wind turbine, engine) and AC voltage appears on stator output. Internal diodes convert AC to ~14V DC on output terminal. Simple retrofit: couple mechanical input shaft to alternator pulley input shaft, extract 12-14V DC power. Typical efficiency 75-85% depending on speed.</p><h3>Output Characteristics</h3><p>Output voltage varies with RPM: 12V at idle speed (1000 RPM), 15V at normal running (2500 RPM). No load voltage may be 18-20V due to internal regulator response delay. Under heavy load, voltage sags to 10-12V. Voltage regulation poor without external regulator. Modern alternators have internal electronic regulator limiting voltage to 14.5V, but regulator assumes constant 12V reference (not accurate with battery disconnected).</p><h3>Open-Circuit vs Load Voltage</h3><p>No load: alternator voltage 15-20V (unregulated). With load, voltage drops: V = Voc - I × Rinternal. A 50A load from 80A alternator (Rinternal = 0.1Ω typical) drops voltage by 5V (50A × 0.1Ω = 5V). Output becomes 10V instead of 15V. Large load requires oversized alternator to maintain voltage, or external voltage regulator.</p></section><section id=voltage-regulation><h2>Voltage Regulation Modification</h2><h3>External Regulator Installation</h3><p>Remove internal regulator (some alternators allow plug-out connector; others require solder removal). Install external voltage regulator maintaining stable output. Common external regulator: comparator circuit with series pass transistor. Input: alternator output, reference voltage. If output > reference (typically 14.5V), reduce transistor conduction, dropping output voltage. Simple circuit costs $50-100 to build or purchase.</p><h3>Linear Regulator Circuit</h3><p>Basic concept: (1) Zener diode reference (14.7V typical). (2) Comparator detecting output voltage vs reference. (3) Series pass transistor (or MOSFET) controlling rotor field current. Lower field current = lower output voltage. Feedback loop maintains constant output regardless of load. Dissipates excess power as heat: at 50A load from 80A alternator, regulator dissipates (20A × 14.5V) = 290W as heat. Requires substantial heatsink.</p><h3>Boost Converter Alternative</h3><p>Instead of dissipating excess power, boost converter (DC-DC converter) steps up 12V to higher voltage or steps down at high current. Example: 12V, 80A alternator output converted to 24V, 40A (same power 960W, doubled voltage, halved current). Useful for systems requiring higher voltage (motor control, wind turbine charging). Conversion efficiency 90-95%, better than linear regulator (75-85%).</p><h3>Load Balancing Strategy</h3><p>Instead of voltage regulation, match load to alternator output power. A 80A alternator at 14V = 1120W. Supply constant power load (1000W) from battery bank: draw voltage proportional to input voltage (higher input = lower current draw, lower input = higher current draw). Load controller circuit maintains constant power draw, naturally regulating voltage by absorbing excess power.</p></section><section id=pulley-design><h2>Pulley Ratios & Speed Calculations</h2><h3>Pulley Ratio & Output Power</h3><p>Alternator output power = Torque × Angular velocity = Magnetic flux × Current × Constant. At constant magnetic flux, doubling RPM roughly doubles power output (less than 2× due to temperature rise reducing efficiency). A 55A alternator at 1500 RPM produces 770W; same alternator at 3000 RPM produces ~1400W.</p><h3>Pulley Sizing Calculation</h3><p>Driven speed = Driver speed × (Driver pulley diameter / Driven pulley diameter). Example: water wheel turns 100 RPM with 10-inch pulley. Alternator needs 2000 RPM for rated output. Pulley ratio = 2000 / 100 = 20:1. Driver pulley 10 inches × 20 = 200-inch driven pulley (impractical). Solution: use multi-stage gearing (100 RPM → 500 RPM gearbox → 2000 RPM alternator with 4:1 pulley).</p><h3>Belt Slip & Power Loss</h3><p>V-belt friction provides torque transmission. Maximum torque = belt tension × pulley radius. Insufficient tension = belt slip (chattering noise, power loss). Excessive tension = bearing overload. Typical belt operates 50-150 kg tension depending on width and length. Assess by thumb pressure: belt deflection 10mm with moderate pressure (not too tight, not too loose).</p><h3>Bearing Load from Pulley</h3><p>Pulley belt tension creates radial load on alternator bearing. High tension (to prevent slip) or large pulley diameter increases bearing load. Example: 100 kg belt tension × 10 cm radius pulley = 1000 N radial load. Automotive alternator bearings rated ~500-1000 N radial load. Oversizing torque demand (large pulley or tight belt) overloads bearing, causing accelerated wear.</p></section><section id=wind-turbine><h2>Wind Turbine Integration</h2><h3>Generator Selection for Wind</h3><p>Wind generator needs high output at low speed (wind turbines turn 60-200 RPM typically). Standard automotive alternator at 60 RPM produces minimal power (5-10% of rating). Solution: (1) Large pulley on turbine, small pulley on alternator (20-40:1 ratio) steps up speed. (2) Use larger alternator (stronger magnetic field, higher output at given speed). (3) Permanent-magnet alternator (designed for low-RPM generation, higher efficiency).</p><h3>Variable-Speed Operation</h3><p>Wind speed varies 0-25 m/s continuously. Optimal turbine tip speed maintains constant 6-8 m/s relative to wind (varies with wind speed). This creates huge speed variation: 20 RPM in light wind, 200 RPM in strong wind. Alternator output varies 100:1, voltage unstable. Solution: (1) Rectify and battery-charge (battery voltage regulates output). (2) Dump load (resistive heater dissipates excess power). (3) MPPT controller (tracks maximum power point over speed range).</p><h3>Startup & Furling</h3><p>Alternator needs minimum RPM (1000 RPM typical) to generate output. Low-wind conditions (wind speed <3 m/s) insufficient to turn turbine and generate power. Furling system (tail vane or mechanical brake) stops turbine in extreme wind (>12 m/s) to prevent overspeed. Without furling, alternator overspeed causes bearing failure and electrical fault.</p><h3>Generator Sizing Example</h3><p>Small wind turbine 1m diameter blades, 60 RPM in 8 m/s wind. Pulley ratio 30:1 → 1800 RPM alternator input. 70A alternator at 1800 RPM produces ~900W. Annual average wind 6 m/s → ~40% of rating = 360W average power = 3.2 kWh/day. Useful for small off-grid cabin; insufficient for household demand (typical 20-30 kWh/day).</p></section><section id=welding-machine><h2>Welding Machine Conversion</h2><h3>Alternator as Welding Supply</h3><p>AC welder (typically 60-100A capacity) can be created using alternator as power source. Stator output (3-phase AC) can be directly tapped for AC welding without rectification. Output voltage 30-60V AC (higher than automotive 12-14V due to multiple stator phases). Current 60-100A typical for large automotive alternator.</p><h3>AC vs DC Welding</h3><p><strong>AC welding:</strong> Direct stator output frequency 50-60 Hz. Arc unstable at 50/60 Hz (flickering). AC welder typically uses 300-1000 Hz for better arc control. Alternator output unsuitable without frequency conversion.</p><p><strong>DC welding:</strong> Rectified alternator output suitable. Full-wave rectifier on stator output (or use internal diodes already present) produces ~50V DC at low current. Current limiting resistor or inductor controls output: I = V / R. A 50V, 100A alternator with 0.5Ω series resistor limits current to 50A (welds thin sheet metal). Suitable for field welding in remote locations.</p><h3>Welder Circuit Design</h3><p>Rectified output 50V DC fed through current-limiting inductor (large choke). Inductor prevents rapid current changes that cause arc instability. Output current setting: adjusted by changing inductor size or adding variable resistor. Electrode negative terminal, work piece positive terminal typical polarity (DCEP). Minimum safe voltage for striking arc: 15-20V.</p><h3>Practical Considerations</h3><p>Alternator spinning at 3000+ RPM to produce welding current. Power: 50V × 100A = 5000W continuous. Driving alternator requires 5-10 kW engine or mechanical input. Not practical for portable welding without substantial power source. More suitable for stationary installation: engine-driven alternator for field fabrication work.</p></section><section id=efficiency><h2>Efficiency & Performance</h2><h3>Thermal Losses</h3><p>Copper I²R loss in stator windings: P = I² × R. At 80A output, 0.1Ω stator resistance: loss = 6400 × 0.1 = 640W dissipated as heat. Efficiency = Output power / (Output power + Losses) = (80A × 14V) / (1120 + 640) = 64%. Larger alternators (lower resistance) achieve 75-85% efficiency. Automotive use: efficient cooling from engine coolant improves output and lifespan.</p><h3>Load Sensitivity</h3><p>Light load: alternator efficiency good (output more, losses less as percentage). Full load: efficiency worst (maximum I² losses). Example: 20A load, 1120 - 640 = 480W output = 72.5% efficiency. 80A load = 1120W output, 640W loss = 63% efficiency (worse). Operating at 50-70% rated load improves efficiency (still producing good power, but lower losses).</p><h3>Temperature-Dependent Efficiency</h3><p>Hot alternator: winding resistance increases ~0.5% per degree. Efficiency falls as heat increases. Hot running (>100°C case) reduces efficiency by 10-15% vs room temperature. Adequate cooling maintains efficiency: 60-70°C case temperature typical for sustained operation.</p></section><section id=troubleshooting><h2>Troubleshooting & Testing</h2><h3>Output Voltage Test</h3><p>No load: spin alternator and measure voltage (should increase with speed, reaching 15-20V at 5000 RPM). Voltage not rising? Regulator may be pulling too much field current. Check diodes (one shorted = low output). Stator coil dead (continuity test on stator leads).</p><p>Full load test: connect 50A resistive load, measure voltage under load. Voltage sag excessive (>3V)? Alternator internal resistance high (failed diode, stator coil partially open). Internal regulator not functioning (constant high voltage regardless of load indicates shorted diode bridge).</p><h3>Diode Testing</h3><p>Diode bridge in most alternators accessible (remove regulator bracket). Test each diode (6 total) with multimeter diode setting. Forward voltage: 0.6-0.7V acceptable. Reverse voltage: should read open circuit. Any diode shorted (low resistance both directions) = failed rectifier. Replace diode module ($50-100) or entire alternator.</p><h3>Brush Condition Assessment</h3><p>Excessive sparking at slip rings indicates worn brushes (arcing between brush and ring). Brushes <2mm remaining length require replacement. Visual inspection: open alternator case (6-8 bolts typically), observe brush length and soot accumulation. New brush set $30-60.</p><h3>Bearing Inspection</h3><p>Spin alternator by hand (unpowered). Should rotate freely with no grinding sound. Grinding = bearing damage (sand/debris inside). Worn bearing: play in rotor (1-2mm side-to-side movement), whining noise under load. Bearing replacement requires internal disassembly; often cheaper to replace whole unit ($100-300 used).</p></section><div class=warning><strong>Safety Warning:</strong> Alternators can deliver 50-100 amps at 14-24V. This current is sufficient for severe electrical burns. High-voltage boost converter outputs can exceed 50V—lethal shock hazard. Never touch live terminals or exposed conductors while alternator spinning or powered. Spinning alternators can catch hair, jewelry, clothing—wear protective gear. Wind turbine alternators spin at high speed in uncontrolled environment (gusty wind)—mechanical failure can eject rotor parts with dangerous velocity. Enclose moving parts with protective guard.</strong></div><div class=tip><strong>Testing Tip:</strong> Before using repurposed alternator in critical application, test thoroughly under load. Run 1-2 hours at full rated current to identify thermal issues (exceeding acceptable temperature). Monitor voltage stability under load variation (step loads on/off, ensuring voltage doesn't sag excessively). Alternators commonly fail under conditions different from automotive use (continuous high current, outdoor exposure, uncontrolled ambient temperature).</tip><div class=related role="navigation" aria-label="Related guides"><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href=electrical-generation.html>Power Generation</a><a href=electrical-motors.html>Electric Motors</a><a href=power-distribution.html>Power Distribution</a><a href=vehicle-conversion.html>Vehicle Conversion</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium &mdash; Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
