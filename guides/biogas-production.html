Hydrolytic bacteria break complex polymers (cellulose, proteins, fats) into simple sugars and amino acids. Acidogenic bacteria ferment these into organic acids and alcohols. Acetogenic bacteria convert these into acetic acid and hydrogen. Methanogenic archaea finally convert acetate and hydrogen/CO₂ into methane (CH₄) and carbon dioxide (CO₂).</p><p>The process requires: (1) anaerobic environment (zero dissolved oxygen), (2) neutral pH (6.5-7.5 optimal), (3) appropriate temperature (20-35°C mesophilic range fastest), (4) balanced C:N ratio in feedstock (25:1 to 30:1 ideal), (5) retention time 20-60 days, (6) regular feeding without disruption.</p><p>Biogas typically contains 50-70% CH₄ (energy-producing), 30-50% CO₂ (inert ballast), 0-5% H₂S (corrosive), traces of N₂, H₂, and H₂O. Energy content approximately 21-24 MJ/m³ methane.</p><svg viewbox='0 0 600 400' style='background:#2d2416;margin:20px 0;border-radius:8px;max-width:100%;height:auto' aria-label='Biogas Production diagram 1'><rect width="600" height="400" fill="#2d2416"></rect><text x="300" y="30" fill="#d4a574" font-size="18" font-weight="bold" text-anchor="middle">Fixed-Dome Digester Cross-Section</text><path d='M 120 80 L 480 80 Q 500 100 500 150 L 500 320 Q 480 350 300 350 Q 120 350 100 320 L 100 150 Q 100 100 120 80' fill="#1a2e1a" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2/"><text x="300" y="120" fill="#d4a574" font-size="12" font-weight="bold" text-anchor="middle">Gas Space</text><text x="300" y="140" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="10" text-anchor="middle">(Biogas)</text><rect x="140" y="170" width="320" height="140" fill="#3a4a3a" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="1/"><text x="300" y="235" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="11" text-anchor="middle">Digestion Chamber</text><text x="300" y="250" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="10" text-anchor="middle">(Fermentation Sludge)</text><line x1="80" y1="80" x2="60" y2="60" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="3/"><text x="40" y="65" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="9">Gas Outlet</text><line x1="520" y1="200" x2="560" y2="200" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2/"><text x="565" y="205" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="9">Feedstock In</text><line x1="100" y1="320" x2="80" y2="360" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2/"><text x="50" y="370" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="9">Digestate Out</text><line x1="520" y1="320" x2="550" y2="360" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="2" stroke-dasharray="4,4"></line><text x="555" y="365" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="9">Drainage/pH adjustment</text><path d='M 300 80 L 300 50' stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="2" stroke-dasharray="3,3"></path><text x="350" y="70" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="9">Gas accumulation</text></svg></section><section id="feedstock"><h2>Feedstock Selection and Carbon:Nitrogen Ratio</h2><p>The C:N ratio determines bacterial nutrition balance. Carbon provides energy; nitrogen builds cell structures. Imbalance causes inhibition or incomplete digestion.</p><h3>Ideal C:N Ratios</h3><p>Optimal range 25:1 to 30:1. If C:N too high (>40:1), nitrogen becomes limiting - methanogens starve and gas production drops. If too low (<15:1), ammonia accumulates to toxic levels, inhibiting archaea. Measure by: C:N = (% carbon) / (% nitrogen) in dry mass.</p><h3>Common Feedstock C:N Values</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Material<th scope="row">C:N Ratio<th scope="row">Moisture<th scope="row">Best Use<tr><td>Cow manure<td>20:1<td>80-90%<td>Primary feedstock, balanced<tr><td>Horse manure<td>25:1<td>75-85%<td>Good primary material<tr><td>Chicken manure<td>8:1<td>60-75%<td>Mix with carbon sources, too N-rich<tr><td>Pig manure<td>15:1<td>85-92%<td>Good, slight nitrogen excess<tr><td>Straw<td>80:1<td>15%<td>Carbon source only, combine with manure<tr><td>Grass clippings<td>25:1<td>70%<td>Good alone or mixed<tr><td>Food waste<td>15:1<td>70-85%<td>Good, add straw for balance<tr><td>Corn stalks<td>60:1<td>20%<td>Carbon source, needs manure<tr><td>Kitchen scraps<td>12:1<td>75%<td>Mix with straw/sawdust<tr><td>Paper/cardboard<td>200:1<td>5%<td>Minimal use, too carbon-heavy</table><h3>Feedstock Preparation</h3><p>Chop material into pieces 10-50mm for faster digestion. Particle size increases surface area for bacterial attack. Very fine particles (<10mm) compact and reduce permeability; very coarse (>100mm) digest slowly. Pre-wet dry materials 24 hours before feeding. Remove plastic, metal, glass, stones, and diseased plants.</p><p>For maximum gas yield: use waste-generated feedstock (manure, agricultural residues, kitchen scraps). Avoid synthetic compounds, persistent pesticides, heavy metals, and antibiotics (inhibit methanogens). pH-adjust with calcium carbonate if feedstock is acidic.</p></section><section id="fixed-dome"><h2>Fixed-Dome Digester Design</h2><p>The fixed-dome type uses underground concrete or brick structure with integral gas storage above digestion chamber. Lowest-cost design for permanent installation. No moving parts but gas pressure varies with digestion level.</p><h3>Construction Specifications</h3><p><strong>Size:</strong> Capacity 10-50m³ typical for household/small farm. Larger = slower response but higher gas buffering. Depth 2-3 times width for structural stability.</p><p><strong>Materials:</strong> Brick or stone with cement mortar (1 cement : 4 sand by volume), or monolithic concrete (1 cement : 2.5 sand : 4 gravel). Waterproof interior with two coats cement plaster (1 cement : 3 sand). Apply sealant - lime-based plaster acceptable for slight permeability; add 10% tallow or linseed oil for water repellency.</p><p><strong>Dome Shape:</strong> Hemispherical or parabolic dome distributes gas pressure evenly. Avoid flat tops - pressure concentrates at corners. Dome height 1-1.5m provides gas space: larger = more gas buffering, reduced pressure swings.</p><h3>Component Layout</h3><ol><li><strong>Feedstock inlet:</strong> Positioned at digester height minus 1m (submerged). Use 150-200mm diameter pipe sloped downward into chamber, extending to near bottom. Prevents short-circuiting of gas. Can be sealed with valve for feeding control<li><strong>Digestate outlet:</strong> At digester bottom or 0.5m above bottom. Use 100-150mm pipe with valve for periodic discharge (monthly to quarterly depending on loading rate)<li><strong>Gas outlet:</strong> At dome apex. Use 50-75mm pipe sloped downward - prevents liquid siphoning back from downstream pipes. Include water trap (inverted U-tube with water seal preventing backward flow of atmospheric oxygen)<li><strong>pH adjustment:</strong> Secondary pipe to bottom allowing limestone slurry or sodium carbonate injection if pH drops below 6.5<li><strong>Temperature control:</strong> For cooler climates, install heating element (10-20kW electric heater or hot water circulation). Maintain 30-35°C for optimal rate</ol><h3>Operation</h3><p>Load daily or every other day at 3-5% of digester volume (daily feeding rate). For 20m³ digester, add 600-1000 liters feedstock mixture per day. Monitor feedstock temperature - preheat in winter above ambient. Feed consistently; irregular feeding disrupts bacterial colonies. Monitor gas production and pressure.</p><div class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Bury digester deeply (1-2m underground) for insulation. Earth provides thermal mass reducing temperature swings. In cold climates, this halves heating needs compared to above-ground digester.</div></section><section id="floating-drum"><h2>Floating-Drum Digester Design</h2><p>Floating-drum type uses cylindrical steel or plastic drum floating on digestion chamber. Drum rises and falls with gas pressure, maintaining constant pressure. Better for consistent downstream use but requires sealing/maintenance of drum.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Chamber:</strong> Underground concrete pit (2-4m deep, 3-6m diameter). Plastered and sealed as in fixed-dome. Cost similar or lower for large volumes.</p><p><strong>Floating Drum:</strong> Steel drum (200-liter standard size) or larger fabricated steel cylinder (1-2m diameter, 1.5-2m height). Paint exterior with coal tar or epoxy for corrosion protection. Install guide rails on 4 sides (angle iron or wood) preventing drum rotation and tilting. Drum must move smoothly (0.5-2m travel) without binding.</p><p><strong>Gas connections:</strong> Top of drum has outlet pipe (50-75mm) leading to gas user. Drum bottom submerged ~10-20cm in liquid, creating seal preventing gas escape. Outlet includes water trap at drum exit.</p><h3>Advantages and Disadvantages</h3><p>Advantages: constant delivery pressure, simpler downstream piping (no pressure regulation needed), drum position visually indicates gas volume, easier repair (can raise drum for access). Disadvantages: drum corrosion requires periodic painting, more complex initial setup, larger footprint, O-ring seals deteriorate (15-20 year lifespan).</p><h3>Maintenance</h3><p>Inspect drum quarterly for leaks, corrosion pinholes, and guide rail wear. Apply corrosion-inhibiting paint every 2-3 years. Check bottom seal - water level should stay constant. If water level drops, seal leaks and needs resealing. Replace O-rings every 15-20 years or when leaks develop.</p></section><section id="plastic-bag"><h2>Plastic-Bag Digester Systems</h2><p>Simplest design for small-scale production using plastic film tube 1.5-3m long, 0.5-2m diameter, positioned on ground or in shallow trench. Ideal for households with 5-20 animals.</p><h3>Construction</h3><p><strong>Bag Material:</strong> Linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) film 200-300 micron thickness, opaque dark color (prevents algae). Obtain industrial plastic sheeting or use multilayer bag construction (2-3 layers for redundancy). Bag is often 3-5m long when laid out.</p><p><strong>Assembly:</strong> Lay plastic on level ground. Feedstock inlet pipe emerges from bottom at one end, sealed with rubber ring. Digestate outlet similar at opposite end. Gas outlet at high point of bag. Fill with inoculum (starter culture of digester sludge from working system or cattle manure) and feedstock. Seal inlet/outlet and gas lines tightly.</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> Place in sheltered spot protected from wind and UV (shade cloth recommended). Bury partially (0.5m) if ground temperature <15°C for insulation. Lay on sand or gravel base for drainage.</p><h3>Operation</h3><p>Load 5-10 kg feedstock every 2-3 days for 1m³ bag capacity. Monitor bag pressure - should be gently tense, not slack or balloon-tight. Pressure fluctuations are normal as gas is withdrawn. Expect 0.1-0.3m³ gas per kg feedstock dry matter (varies with composition and retention time).</p><p>Replace bag every 3-5 years (UV and thermal stress degrade plastic). Digester sludge can be transferred to new bag, retaining bacteria. Smaller replacement rate needed than large digesters due to faster microbial refresh.</p><h3>Advantages</h3><p>Lowest capital cost ($200-500 installation), easy construction, portable, works in cold climates when provided with passive solar cover, minimal land requirement, scalable (add bags for more gas). Disadvantages: shorter lifespan, cannot maintain high temperature without heating, requires more frequent replacement, difficult to stir/mix contents.</p><div class="warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Plastic bags can rupture from sharp rocks, excessive pressure, or UV degradation. Inspect weekly for leaks - smell indicates gas loss. Have spare plastic and repair kit (adhesive patches) ready. Bag failure results in aerobic conditions and odor generation. Immediate repair or bag replacement required.</div></section><section id="temperature"><h2>Temperature Control and Microbiology</h2><p>Bacterial communities thrive at specific temperature ranges. Temperature directly controls reaction rates and gas production.</p><h3>Temperature Regimes</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Regime<th scope="row">Temperature<th scope="row">Gas Production<th scope="row">Retention Time<th scope="row">Stability<th scope="row">Application<tr><td>Psychrophilic<td>5-20°C<td>Slow<td>100-150 days<td>Poor<td>Cold climates, no heating<tr><td>Mesophilic<td>20-40°C (opt 35°C)<td>Fast<td>20-40 days<td>Good<td>Standard, recommended<tr><td>Thermophilic<td>40-60°C (opt 55°C)<td>Very Fast<td>10-15 days<td>Sensitive<td>Industrial, high throughput</table><p><strong>Mesophilic (30-35°C):</strong> Optimal for small-scale digesters. Bacterial communities most diverse and stable. Gas yield ~0.4m³ per kg feedstock dry matter. Tolerates slight upsets. Methanogens sensitive to temperature swings >5°C; maintain steady temperature.</p><p><strong>Thermophilic (50-55°C):</strong> Faster digestion (halved retention time) but requires precision temperature control. Pathogen destruction better (aids disease prevention). Archaea more sensitive - temperature fluctuations >2°C inhibit methane production. Power-intensive heating needed.</p><h3>Heating Methods</h3><p><strong>Solar:</strong> For warm climates, south-facing black tank absorbs heat. Passive approach, no cost, but weather-dependent.</p><p><strong>Biogas-fired heater:</strong> Recycle 10-20% of produced gas through simple burner to heat water. Water circulates through coil in digester or around external tank. Allows self-heating once digester operating. Requires heat exchanger construction.</p><p><strong>Electric heater:</strong> Immersion heaters (10-20kW) for steady temperature. Thermostat control at 35°C. Cost 100-200W per m³ digester volume during winter. Expensive if grid power unavailable.</p><p><strong>Compost heating:</strong> In cold climates, place digester in insulated greenhouse with compost pile nearby. Compost generates 40-60°C heat. Greenhouse retains warmth. Combined approach can reduce separate heating by 50%.</p><h3>Inoculation and Startup</h3><p>New digester requires starter culture of active methanogens. Sources: (1) sludge from established digester (20-30% of volume), (2) fresh cattle manure (contains wild methanogens, slower start), (3) commercial anaerobic inoculum (expensive but reliable). Mix inoculum with feedstock at 40-50°C before adding to digester. Gas production typically begins within 5-10 days at mesophilic temperature, 2-3 days thermophilic.</p></section><section id="collection"><h2>Gas Collection and Storage</h2><p>Biogas must be collected from digester, dried, and stored before use. Gas pressure varies with digestion level, requiring pressure regulation downstream.</p><h3>Piping and Drains</h3><p>Use 50-75mm diameter pipes (PVC, HDPE, or galvanized steel - avoid copper/brass which corrode in H₂S). Slope all pipes downward toward digester at 1:100 minimum (prevent liquid traps). Install water drain taps at low points - drain daily initially, weekly when stable. Include manual drain valves for maintenance shutdown.</p><p>Gas velocity should be 1-3 m/s in pipes. Higher velocity causes friction loss; lower velocity allows water vapor condensation and H₂S settling. Size pipe diameter using: Flow (m³/h) ÷ velocity (m/s) = area (m²). For example, 1m³/h at 2 m/s = 0.5m² = 0.8m diameter pipe (use 75mm).</p><h3>Condensation and Water Removal</h3><p>Biogas emerges at digester temperature (30-35°C) nearly saturated with water vapor. As it cools in pipelines, water condenses. Install water trap (vertical pipe with drain at bottom) every 10-20m horizontal run. Draw sediment to bottom, drain weekly.</p><p>For dry gas, pass through condenser: coil of pipe cooled by ice bath or underground water circulation. Water precipitates, settles, and is drained. Alternatively, use desiccant cartridge (silica gel, activated charcoal) - changes color when saturated, replace weekly when in heavy use.</p><h3>Pressure Control</h3><p>Fixed-dome digesters produce variable pressure (0-50 kPa depending on digestion level). Downstream equipment (stove, burner) typically requires constant 1-10 kPa pressure. Install pressure regulator valve - simple design uses float-controlled valve that maintains constant outlet pressure.</p><p>For floating-drum digesters, pressure is naturally constant (equals drum weight + atmospheric). Regulation less critical; simple pressure relief valve (popping at 5-10 kPa) protects system.</p><h3>Gas Meters</h3><p>Simple wet-test meter (soap bubble timer) measures gas flow: known volume of inverted tube filled with soapy water, measure time for bubble to traverse, calculate volume/time. Accuracy ±5%, costs nothing to construct. For permanent installation, use dry meter (rotary vane or turbine meter) recording volume.</p><div class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Install simple manometer (water-filled U-tube) to monitor digester pressure. Reading above 10cm H₂O indicates high pressure - reduce gas withdrawal or digestate accumulation. Below 2cm indicates low gas volume - increase feeding or check for leaks.</div></section><section id="h2s-removal"><h2>Hydrogen Sulfide Removal</h2><p>H₂S (rotten egg smell) is corrosive, toxic, and damages equipment. Typical concentration 0-5%, occasionally higher with sulfur-containing feedstock (animal proteins, sulfate). H₂S must be reduced to <100 ppm for safe use.</p><h3>Iron Oxide Method</h3><p>Most practical for small-scale. Iron oxide (rust, Fe₂O₃) reacts with H₂S forming insoluble iron sulfide. Construct iron oxide scrubber: perforated pipes (1-2m long, 75mm diameter) filled with iron oxide pellets, scrap iron, or steel wool. Gas passes through at 1-3 m/s. H₂S reacts: 2Fe₂O₃ + 6H₂S → 2Fe₃S₄ + 6H₂O.</p><p><strong>Construction:</strong> Use PVC or steel pipe with inlet at bottom, outlet at top. Fill with rust - obtain from old rust deposits, steel wool pads (accelerate rusting by wetting), or roofing tiles. Compact loosely to avoid pressure drop. Install drain at base (some liquid forms). Replace media every 6-12 months when efficiency drops.</p><p><strong>Performance:</strong> Reduces H₂S from 2% to <100 ppm. Initial media more effective (days 1-7). Regeneration possible: expose saturated media to air/oxygen (ruins scrubber function but can be reused if dried).</p><h3>Biological Scrubbing</h3><p>Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria consume H₂S in moist environment. Construct biological scrubber: packed-bed reactor with porous media (woodchips, plastic packing) continuously dripped with water circulating pump. Gas bubbles through media, bacteria oxidize H₂S to sulfur (yellow deposit, can be collected as byproduct: 2H₂S + O₂ → 2S + 2H₂O).</p><p>Maintenance: keep media moist (daily circulation), prevent anaerobic conditions (ensure adequate air), maintain pH 6-8 (add lime if acidifies). More complex than iron oxide, better long-term. Cost higher but reusable indefinitely.</p><h3>Air Injection</h3><p>Simple: inject small amount of air (1-5% of gas flow) into digester or gas stream. Thiobacillus bacteria in digester oxidize H₂S to sulfur: 2H₂S + O₂ → 2S + 2H₂O. Sulfur settles as solid in digester/separator vessel. Risk: excessive air can ignite methane (explosive: 5-15% CH₄ in air is flammable). Limit air strictly - maintain well below 2% oxygen in biogas to avoid flash point.</p></section><section id="co2-scrubbing"><h2>CO₂ Scrubbing for Purity</h2><p>Biogas contains 30-50% CO₂, reducing energy density to 21-24 MJ/m³. For transport/storage, CO₂ removal increases energy content to 37 MJ/m³ (pure methane). Produces biomethane approaching natural gas quality.</p><h3>Water Scrubbing</h3><p>Most common method: CO₂ dissolves in water (Henry's law) but CH₄ poorly soluble. Bubble gas through water column 3-5m high. CO₂ absorbs preferentially (ratio 30:1), leaving enriched methane. Design: packed column (woodchips, Raschig rings, plastic packing) with water fed at top, circulating at 0.5-1 m³/h per m² column area. Gas exits 95-98% CH₄.</p><p>Disposal: CO₂-saturated water becomes slightly acidic (carbonic acid). Periodically drain and replace, or regenerate by heating (boiling drives CO₂ out). Water cycle: cost ~$0.01 per m³ gas treated (minimal water loss).</p><h3>Amine Scrubbing</h3><p>Chemical absorption using ethanolamine or monoethanolamine (MEA) solutions. Better efficiency, smaller equipment, but toxic chemicals requiring careful handling. Gas 95%+ CH₄ achievable. Regenerate solution by heating, recovering CO₂ as byproduct (useful for greenhouse, fermentation). Industrial scale, complex chemistry - not recommended for survival-level systems.</p><h3>Pressure Swing Adsorption</h3><p>Activated charcoal or molecular sieves preferentially adsorb CO₂ at high pressure. Equipment expensive, requires compressor (5-10 bar), best for <5 m³/h applications. Complex maintenance, not practical for small-scale.</p><h3>When Worth Doing</h3><p>CO₂ removal valuable if: (1) transporting biogas >10km (energy density improves margins), (2) long-term storage needed, (3) combined with liquefaction for vehicle fuel. For on-site use (cooking, heating, local generator), raw biogas acceptable - CO₂ merely reduces flame temperature slightly, not efficiency if burned completely.</p></section><section id="yields"><h2>Gas Yield Calculations</h2><p>Predicting gas production allows system sizing and planning. Yields vary significantly with feedstock type, temperature, and digestion time.</p><h3>Typical Methane Yields</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Material<th scope="row">Yield (m³/kg dry matter)<th scope="row">Yield (m³/kg wet)<th scope="row">Retention Time<th scope="row">Notes<tr><td>Cow manure<td>0.20-0.25<td>0.02-0.03<td>30-40 days<td>Standard reference<tr><td>Food waste<td>0.40-0.60<td>0.08-0.12<td>20-30 days<td>Fast digestion, higher yield<tr><td>Plant waste (mixed)<td>0.15-0.25<td>0.01-0.03<td>40-60 days<td>Variable, slow<tr><td>Straw<td>0.10-0.15<td>0.01-0.02<td>60-90 days<td>Low nitrogen, slow<tr><td>Brewery waste<td>0.50-0.70<td>0.10-0.15<td>15-25 days<td>Very high yield, requires careful pH<tr><td>Algae (dried)<td>0.30-0.50<td>0.03-0.05<td>30-40 days<td>Emerging feedstock, good yield</table><p><strong>Estimation formula:</strong> Daily biogas (m³) = [(kg feedstock/day) × (% dry matter/100) × (yield m³/kg dry matter)] ÷ (retention time days) × (efficiency factor 0.7-0.9)</p><p>Example: 50 kg cow manure daily (80% wet, 20% dry matter), 30-day retention, 0.22 m³/kg dry matter yield, 0.80 efficiency. Daily gas = [50 × 0.20 × 0.22 ÷ 30 × 0.80] = 0.59 m³/day ≈ 18 m³/month = 4.3 hours of cooking per day on typical stove.</p><h3>Seasonal Variation</h3><p>Cold climates: gas production drops 40-60% in winter (temperature-dependent). Mesophilic digesters in unheated systems produce 0.1-0.15 m³/kg feedstock in winter vs. 0.25+ in summer. Heat investment justified if year-round supply needed. Thermophilic systems maintain production with heating but cost more.</p></section><section id="troubleshooting"><h2>Troubleshooting and Maintenance</h2><h3>No Gas Production</h3><p><strong>Cause:</strong> pH too acidic/alkaline, temperature too cold, insufficient inoculum, feedstock toxicity, anaerobic pathway blocked. <strong>Check:</strong> pH (should be 6.5-7.5), temperature (should be 30-35°C), inoculum age (active <3 months). <strong>Solution:</strong> Add lime (CaCO₃) if pH <6.0 to raise pH. Add soda ash if pH >7.5 to lower. Increase temperature slowly (+1-2°C/day) to 35°C if cold. If feedstock toxic (e.g., antibiotic residue), replace with fresh manure. Wait 2-4 weeks for bacterial recovery.</p><h3>Low Gas Production</h3><p><strong>Cause:</strong> Accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFA), substrate competition, age of digester culture. <strong>Indicators:</strong> pH dropping, sour smell, reduced flow. <strong>Solution:</strong> Reduce feedstock rate by 50% for 1-2 weeks, increase retention time. Add alkalinity (sodium carbonate or lime). Monitor daily, gradually restore feeding rate when pH stabilizes.</p><h3>Foul Smell / Rotten Eggs</h3><p><strong>Cause:</strong> Leaking H₂S gas or anaerobic zones near outlet. <strong>Solution:</strong> Inspect all seals/connections for leaks. Ensure gas is withdrawn regularly (prevents H₂S buildup). Increase iron oxide scrubbing. If digester outlet smells, sludge is being withdrawn with gas - raise outlet pipe higher or install sediment trap.</p><h3>Digester Boiling/Excessive Bubbling</h3><p><strong>Cause:</strong> Temperature too high (>45°C), excessive feeding, or pressure release. <strong>Solution:</strong> Reduce temperature to 35°C. Reduce feedstock rate. Ensure gas outlet is not blocked - pressure buildup causes violent digestion. Check for leaks under pressure.</p><h3>Floating Drum Stuck</h3><p><strong>Cause:</strong> Sediment buildup, corrosion/rust on guide rails, biological scaling. <strong>Solution:</strong> Release digester pressure (open gas outlet), allow drum to settle. Inspect guide rails for sediment and clean with brush. Apply graphite lubricant to rails monthly. If severely stuck, drain system partially and attempt to pry drum with lever (carefully). Rebuild seals if corrosion extensive.</p></section><section id="safety"><h2>Safety Procedures</h2><ul><li><strong>Biogas properties:</strong> Explosive when mixed with air at 5-15% concentration. Never ignite biogas without oxygen scavenging (inject inert gas or run burner continuously). Methane is odorless - add odorant (mercaptan) if available for leak detection<li><strong>Pressure relief:</strong> Install pop-off valve at 30-50 kPa preventing pressure buildup. Pressure >100 kPa risks rupture of pipe joints<li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> CO₂ accumulation causes asphyxiation in confined spaces. Never work inside digester without air supply. Test atmosphere with lit match before entry (flame extinguishes in low-O₂ environment)<li><strong>Handling H₂S:</strong> H₂S is highly toxic at >100 ppm concentration. Symptoms: headache (100 ppm), eye irritation (200 ppm), respiratory damage (>500 ppm). Install H₂S detector in usage area. Ensure scrubber functioning. Ventilate usage rooms<li><strong>Leaks:</strong> Biogas leaks are invisible but detectable by soapy water (bubbles form). Check weekly. Joints should be gasket-sealed or solvent-bonded (PVC) / welded (steel), not thread-sealed with teflon tape alone<li><strong>Feedstock contamination:</strong> Do not feed materials containing heavy metals, persistent pesticides, pharmaceutical residues (inhibit digestion and contaminate digestate). Use digestate only on non-food crops or pasture<li><strong>Digester entry:</strong> Absolutely never enter an active digester. H₂S accumulation and oxygen depletion are fatal within seconds. Only inspect interior after draining and 24 hours ventilation</ul><div class="warning"><strong>Critical Safety:</strong> Biogas is odorless and deadly. Never assume safety without testing. H₂S corrodes copper fittings and steel rapidly - use stainless steel, PVC, or HDPE for long-term. Leaking biogas in enclosed space causes asphyxiation (CO₂, CH₄) or explosion (CH₄ ignition). Maintain system pressure <50 kPa and keep relief valves in working order. Regular maintenance is not optional - is survival necessity.</div></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="waste-management.html">Waste Management Systems</a> | <a href="energy-production.html">Alternative Energy</a> | <a href="composting.html">Composting & Soil Amendment</a> | <a href="chemical-safety.html">Chemical Safety</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
