Duration: varies by species (hours to 1-2 days). <strong>Stage 2 (Expulsive):</strong> Straining begins, offspring delivered through birth canal. Duration: usually <30 minutes per offspring. <strong>Stage 3 (Placental):</strong> Fetal membranes/placenta expelled. Duration: typically <30 minutes per offspring, often overlaps with stage 2 in multi-offspring births.</p><h3>Pre-Partum Signs</h3><ul><li>Relaxation of pelvic ligaments (visible hollows on sides of sacrum)<li>Udder filling (milk production visible)<li>Abdominal relaxation (loose appearance)<li>Behavioral changes: restlessness, isolation, nesting<li>Discharge from vulva (mucus plug, bloody discharge)<li>Temperature drop 12-24 hours before labor (often 1-2°F below baseline)</ul><h3>Position for Normal Delivery</h3><p>Optimal: anterior presentation (front legs/head first). Posterior presentation (hind legs first): usually manageable in livestock if unobstructed. Lateral/dorsal presentation: problematic, may require assistance. Fetal position within presentation: limbs extended forward = normal; limbs flexed/folded back = obstructive.</p></section><section id=dystocia><h2>Dystocia Recognition and Management</h2><h3>Dystocia Signs</h3><ul><li>Prolonged stage 1 (>2 days without progression to straining)<li>Prolonged stage 2: no offspring after 1-2 hours active straining<li>Straining without progress (pushing for hours, no advancement)<li>Abnormal discharge: foul-smelling, hemorrhagic (dark blood, not normal bloody discharge)<li>Maternal exhaustion, inability to stand<li>Visible signs of infection: fever, lethargy, shock</ul><h3>Dystocia Causes</h3><ul><li><strong>Fetal causes:</strong> Oversized offspring, malpresentation (not front-first or back-first), congenital abnormalities<li><strong>Maternal causes:</strong> Inadequate pelvic size, uterine inertia (weak contractions), maternal illness<li><strong>Environmental causes:</strong> Inadequate space for labor, excessive stress/disturbance</ul><h3>Dystocia Management</h3><p>Gentle assistance may help: 1) Ensure correct diagnosis (sometimes patience allows natural progress). 2) Lubricate birth canal generously with clean lubricant (soap solution acceptable if lubrication unavailable). 3) Assist with gentle traction during contractions (never force); have second person apply gentle counter-traction on maternal body (prevents trauma). 4) If no progress after 15-30 minutes of assisted effort: consider C-section (if resources allow) or extraction of dead fetus (if viable offspring unlikely). 5) Monitor for uterine rupture signs (acute pain, shock, sudden cessation of straining).</p></section><section id=cesarian><h2>Cesarean Section (C-Section)</h2><h3>Indications for C-Section</h3><ul><li>Dystocia unresponsive to 30-60 minutes assisted delivery<li>Fetal malpresentation unable to correct<li>Uterine rupture suspected<li>Maternal illness preventing labor (severe infection, metabolic disease)<li>Oversized offspring (relative to pelvic size) impossible to deliver vaginally</ul><h3>C-Section Procedure (Field Expedient)</h3><ol><li>Anesthesia: sedation (if available) or physical restraint. Local anesthetic at incision site if available.<li>Preparation: clip/shave and disinfect surgical area (skin prep).<li>Incision: midline approach (from xiphoid to umbilicus) or flank approach (quicker, less tissue disruption). 4-6 inch incision sufficient for most livestock.<li>Exteriorize uterus: gentle handling to locate incision (usually on side with most fetuses).<li>Uterine incision: 2-3 inches, careful to avoid fetal damage, avoid severing ligaments.<li>Extract fetuses: grasp and remove gently, clear airways, stimulate breathing (rub if needed).<li>Remove placenta: gently separate from uterine wall if possible (avoid leaving fragments).<li>Close uterus: suture with absorbable suture (catgut if available) in continuous or interrupted pattern.<li>Close abdomen: suture through all layers (muscle, fascia, skin) or drain and allow to heal secondarily if infection risk high.<li>Post-op: fluid support, antibiotics, pain relief, monitoring.</ol><h3>C-Section Survival Considerations</h3><p>Procedure is surgical emergency-level intervention; risk of death (maternal and fetal) high without proper equipment/training. Infection risk significant (peritonitis, sepsis). Pre-survival planning: educate on C-section signs, consider decision to cull if C-section necessary and resources lacking. If attempted: prepare for failure, accept outcome gracefully.</p></section><section id=neonatal><h2>Neonatal Care</h2><h3>Immediate Neonatal Management</h3><ol><li>Clear airways: remove any membranes obstructing breathing. Wipe nose/mouth clear of fluid.<li>Stimulation: vigorous rubbing promotes respiratory effort. If no breathing after 30-60 seconds: may be dead or severely compromised.<li>Cord management: allow placental circulation to cease (3-5 minutes) before cord ligation. Ligate with clean cord clamp or tie; disinfect with iodine if available.<li>Umbilical stump care: keep clean/dry to prevent infection. Disinfect daily with iodine or alcohol until cord falls off (7-10 days).</ol><h3>Neonatal Feeding</h3><p>Colostrum (first milk) critical: provides maternal antibodies, nutrition, laxative effect (clears meconium). First feeding: within 1-2 hours if possible. Frequency: small frequent meals (5-6x daily for first week) better than large infrequent meals. Amount: 5-10% of body weight daily initially (increase as grows). Monitor: vigorous nursing, weight gain, normal elimination.</p><h3>Neonatal Examination</h3><ul><li>Activity level: alert, responsive to dam<li>Breathing: normal rate, no respiratory distress<li>Heart rate: species-dependent (160-200 bpm in newborn lambs/goats)<li>Temperature: monitor for hypothermia (critical in first hours). If cold: warm gently (mother nursing, warm blankets, not external heat source [risk burns])<li>Defects: cleft palate, limb deformities, umbilical hernia</ul></section><section id=post-partum><h2>Post-Partum Management</h2><h3>Maternal Post-Partum Care</h3><p><strong>Placental expulsion:</strong> Should occur within 30-60 minutes per offspring. Retained placenta (>4 hours) risk: infection, septic shock. Management: gentle manual removal if possible (careful, avoid uterine rupture), antibiotics if retained >2 hours, supportive care. <strong>Uterine involution:</strong> Uterus returns to non-pregnant size over weeks. Monitor for: foul discharge (infection), hemorrhage (exceeds normal lochia), maternal fever/toxemia.</p><h3>Dam Health Monitoring</h3><ul><li>Appetite: dam should eat within hours of delivery<li>Udder: monitor for mastitis (swelling, heat, pain, discolored milk). Milk frequently to prevent engorgement. Disinfect udder before milking if planning to harvest for human consumption.<li>Behavior: dam protective but responsive; excessive aggressiveness or unresponsiveness suggests illness<li>Vital signs: fever suggests infection; tachycardia/tachypnea suggests shock/pain</ul><h3>Post-Partum Complications</h3><p><strong>Mastitis:</strong> Bacterial infection of udder. Signs: swelling, pain, temperature, discolored milk. Treatment: frequent milking, hot compresses, antibiotics. <strong>Metritis:</strong> Uterine infection. Signs: fever, foul discharge, lethargy, shock. Treatment: antibiotics, fluid support, often life-threatening if untreated. <strong>Milk fever (hypocalcemia):</strong> Calcium depletion from milk production. Signs: weakness, lethargy, inability to stand. Treatment: calcium supplementation IV (if accessible) or oral.</p></section><section id=species-specific><h2>Species-Specific Considerations</h2><h3>Cattle</h3><p>Gestation: 283 days. Calf size: large, dystocia not uncommon (40-50 lbs calf in small dam). Multiple births: rare. Colostrum: critical (5-6% body weight day 1). Calves stand/suckle: within 1 hour normally.</p><h3>Sheep and Goats</h3><p>Gestation: 150 days (sheep), 145 days (goats). Multiple births: common (twins, triplets). Labor: rapid (can be <30 minutes). Lambs/kids: born relatively mature, stand/nurse quickly (30 minutes-1 hour). Dystocia: common with inexperienced/young dams, malpresentation frequent.</p><h3>Pigs</h3><p>Gestation: 114 days (short). Litter size: 8-10 piglets typical. Farrowing: maternal aggression/crushing risk (requires separate farrowing area). Piglets: born small but vulnerable to chilling. Colostrum: essential (piglets susceptible to disease). Birth interval: 10-15 minutes between piglets.</p><h3>Poultry</h3><p>Egg-laying (no live birth) in most poultry. Brooding/hatching: eggs incubated ~21 days. Chicks/ducklings: vulnerable to chilling initially. Mortality: high if brooding conditions suboptimal (temperature, humidity, space).</p></section><section id=complications><h2>Complications</h2><h3>Uterine Rupture</h3><p>Severe complication from dystocia or excessive pulling on fetus. Signs: acute severe pain, sudden cessation of straining, shock, rapid deterioration. Prognosis: poor without emergency surgery (peritonitis, septic shock). Prevention: avoid excessive force during assisted delivery.</p><h3>Hemorrhage</h3><p>Excessive post-partum bleeding from uterine vessels. Signs: weakness, pale mucous membranes, shock, bright red blood discharge. Management: manual compression of uterus (massage abdomen firmly), oxytocin if available (stimulates uterine contraction, compresses bleeding vessels), fluid support. Severe cases likely fatal without transfusion.</p><h3>Septic Metritis/Peritonitis</h3><p>Infection of uterus/peritoneum from contaminated delivery, retained placenta, or C-section. Signs: fever, severe lethargy, shock, rapid deterioration. Treatment: aggressive antibiotics (broad-spectrum if organism unknown), fluid support, supportive care. Prognosis: poor if advanced (septic shock).</p></section><section id=safety><div class=warning><h3>Critical Veterinary Obstetric Safety</h3><ul><li>Uterine rupture = life-threatening emergency. Avoid excessive force; gentle assistance only. Rupture = likely death of dam and fetus.<li>Infection risk = severe dystocia/C-section high-risk. Use clean technique, antibiotics post-op, monitor closely for infection signs.<li>Hemorrhage = rapid shock/death. Prepare for possible need to cull if hemorrhage uncontrollable.<li>Neonatal hypothermia = death in first hours. Ensure proper drying/warming. Wet neonates in cold environment die rapidly.</ul></div></section><section id=mistakes><div class=mistakes><h3>Common Veterinary Obstetric Errors</h3><ul><li><strong>Excessive pulling force:</strong> Risks uterine rupture, dam death. Use gentle traction only; if not progressing, accept delivery failure.<li><strong>Premature cord cutting:</strong> Reduces placental transfusion of blood to neonate; let cord pulsate until placental circulation ceases.<li><strong>Ignored infection signs:</strong> Fever/discharge = infection until proven otherwise. Treat with antibiotics.<li><strong>Neonatal neglect:</strong> Assume all neonates need assistance. Monitor closely first 24 hours; don't assume survival guaranteed.</ul></div></section><div class=related role="navigation" aria-label="Related guides"><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href=first-aid.html>First Aid</a> • <a href=infection-control.html>Infection Control</a> • <a href=medications.html>Essential Medications</a> • <a href=veterinary-parasitology.html>Veterinary Parasitology</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
