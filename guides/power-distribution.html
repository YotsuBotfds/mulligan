Primary and secondary coils share magnetic flux. Turns ratio determines voltage ratio: Vs/Vp = Ns/Np where V is voltage, N is number of turns, s is secondary, p is primary. An ideal transformer: Vp × Ip = Vs × Is (power in = power out). Real transformers: efficiency 95-99% depending on size and load.</p><h3>Transformer Types</h3><p><strong>Step-up:</strong> Fewer primary turns, many secondary turns. Increases voltage, decreases current. Used in power generation (raising voltage for transmission to reduce losses).</p><p><strong>Step-down:</strong> Many primary turns, fewer secondary. Decreases voltage, increases current. Used to step down transmission voltage to distribution and residential voltages.</p><p><strong>Autotransformer:</strong> Primary and secondary share same winding. More compact, cheaper. Primary and secondary not isolated electrically—cannot be used for safety isolation (e.g., power tools in wet areas).</p><h3>Transformer Sizing & Loading</h3><p>Transformer rated in kVA (apparent power, accounting for reactive load). A 10 kVA transformer can deliver 10,000 watts at unity power factor, or 10,000 × PF at non-unity PF. Continuous load should not exceed 80% of rating (16 A loading for 10 kVA). Intermittent loads up to 100%. Overloading causes excessive heat, shortening transformer life.</p><h3>Cooling & Temperature Rise</h3><p>Dry-type transformer cooled by air circulation. Oil-filled transformer uses mineral oil for cooling and insulation (better thermal conductivity). Temperature rise: difference between winding and ambient temperature. Transformers rated for 65°C rise in 30°C ambient = 95°C maximum winding temperature at rated load. Exceeding temperature rise ratings degrades insulation and shortens life exponentially.</p></section><section id=ac-vs-dc><h2>AC vs DC Power Distribution</h2><h3>Advantages of AC</h3><p>AC voltage easily transformed (voltage conversion critical for efficient long-distance transmission). AC motors simpler and cheaper than DC (no brushes). AC generators brushless. No commutation losses. Induction motors can start directly. Historical precedent and standardization worldwide.</p><h3>Disadvantages of AC</h3><p>Skin effect at high frequencies: current concentrates at conductor surface, increasing resistance. Requires capacitor banks for power factor correction in industrial systems. Radiation and EMI from high-frequency switching. Reactive power component (volt-ampere reactive, VAR) complicates calculations.</p><h3>Advantages of DC</h3><p>No skin effect: entire conductor cross-section carries current. Simpler long-distance power transmission (no reactive power). Can operate synchronous machines without frequency synchronization. Compatible with renewable sources (solar, battery). No transformer needed (but often used for voltage conversion).</p><h3>Disadvantages of DC</h3><p>Difficult to transform voltage (requires DC-DC converter, less efficient than transformer). DC motors require brushes (maintenance, losses). Arc harder to extinguish in high-voltage DC (safety concern). Existing infrastructure all AC. Electrolytic corrosion in DC ground systems.</p><h3>DC Transmission Feasibility</h3><p>High-voltage DC (HVDC) transmission used for long distances (interconnecting regions) and subsea cables. Converter stations at each end (rectifier at sending end, inverter at receiving end) convert AC to DC and back. Cost ≈$500k per converter per 1000 MW. Economical for >200 mile distances. Losses ≈0.65% per 1000 km vs 2-3% for HVAC at same distance.</p></section><section id=voltage-conversion><h2>Voltage Conversion Methods</h2><h3>AC Transformer Conversion</h3><p>Transformer converts AC voltage at 1:1 efficiency (assuming ideal). Step-down from 480V to 120V using 4:1 turns ratio. No intermediate rectification or regulation circuits needed. Cost $500-2000 for 10 kVA transformer depending on type and mounting. Simplest method for AC systems.</p><h3>DC-DC Converters</h3><p><strong>Buck converter:</strong> Steps down DC voltage. Pulse-width modulation (PWM) switches inductor on/off. Output voltage = Input × (Ton / Tperiod). Efficiency typically 85-95%. Used in laptop chargers, automotive electronics, solar charge controllers.</p><p><strong>Boost converter:</strong> Steps up DC voltage. Same PWM principle but capacitor stores energy. Output voltage = Input / (1 - Ton/Tperiod). Useful for battery systems stepping 12V to 48V or 24V to 400V.</p><p><strong>Buck-Boost (Ćuk converter):</strong> Can step voltage up or down. More complex but combines advantages. Good for wide input voltage range.</p><h3>AC-DC Conversion (Rectification & Filtering)</h3><p>Rectifier (diodes or thyristors) converts AC to DC. Full-wave rectifier with filter capacitor achieves 80-90 ripple-free DC. Six-pulse rectifier (used in industrial): gives lower frequency ripple, easier filtering. Twelve-pulse rectifier: even lower ripple. Thyristor rectifiers allow phase control, varying average DC output voltage.</p><h3>DC-AC Conversion (Inversion)</h3><p>Inverter converts DC to AC. Square-wave inverter: cheapest, creates square wave output (1 fundamental + many harmonics, noisy). Modified sine wave: reduces some harmonics. Pure sine wave: H-bridge with PWM creates true sinusoid (expensive, needed for sensitive electronics). Efficiency typically 85-95%.</p></section><section id=load-balancing><h2>Load Balancing & Distribution</h2><h3>Three-Phase Load Balancing</h3><p>Ideally, load equally distributed across three phases. Imbalance creates neutral current: Ineutral = √[(I₁² + I₂² + I₃² - I₁I₂ - I₂I₃ - I₃I₁)]. Large imbalance causes neutral conductor overheating and transformer overheating. Limit imbalance to <10% of average phase current. Redistribute loads: move some single-phase loads from one phase to another until balanced.</p><h3>Dynamic Load Balancing</h3><p>Automatic load transfer switches detect imbalance and reroute loads. Used in industrial facilities with critical loads. Reduces neutral heating and improves transformer cooling. Can tie multiple generators: load-sharing between generators using droop control (each generator operates on slight downward-sloping voltage/load curve).</p><h3>Demand Response & Peak Shaving</h3><p>Utility reduces peak demand by temporarily disconnecting non-essential loads or motivating customers to reduce usage via pricing signals. Water heaters, air conditioners, EVs common candidates. Reduces peak power demand 5-15%, lowering infrastructure cost and improving reliability. Requires automated smart meters and controls.</p></section><section id=grid><h2>Grid Basics & Protection</h2><h3>Three-Level Voltage System</h3><p>Transmission (100-800 kV): long-distance power transfer from generators. Sub-transmission (25-138 kV): regional distribution. Distribution (120-13 kV): neighborhood and building level. Customer (120/240V single-phase or 277/480V three-phase): individual end-use. Step-down transformers connect each level.</p><h3>Fault Types & Clearing</h3><p><strong>Three-phase fault:</strong> All three phases shorted together. Highest fault current, fastest circuit breaker reaction (2-6 cycles). Symmetric current simplifies protection design.</p><p><strong>Single-line-to-ground:</strong> One phase touches ground. Lower fault current but stresses ground return path. Requires sensitive ground-fault relay.</p><p><strong>Line-to-line fault:</strong> Two phases shorted. Intermediate fault current, less common than other types.</p><p><strong>Arcing fault:</strong> Electrical arc between phases or to ground. Current limited by arc resistance (variable with distance). Difficult to detect and clear. Arc flash hazard to workers.</p><h3>Protective Relaying</h3><p>Relay detects fault condition (overcurrent, overvoltage, underfrequency, etc.) and signals breaker to trip. Coordination ensures nearest upstream breaker trips first (selectivity). Time delay on upstream breakers allows downstream breakers to clear first. Directional relays sense fault direction, useful in looped distribution networks.</p><h3>Blackout Prevention</h3><p>Under-frequency load shedding (UFLS): automatic disconnect of loads if frequency drops below threshold (indicates generation shortfall). Cascading trips prevented by staged load shedding. Spinning reserve: extra generating capacity running at zero output, ready to increase in 5 minutes. Critical for grid stability.</p></section><section id=microgrids><h2>Microgrid Design & Control</h2><h3>Microgrid Concept</h3><p>Localized group of controllable loads and distributed energy resources (generators, solar, wind, storage) operating as coherent unit. Can operate grid-connected (parallel with utility) or islanded (disconnected from main grid). Improves resilience, reduces losses, allows integration of renewables.</p><h3>Control Architecture</h3><p><strong>Centralized:</strong> Single controller manages all resources. More complex but can optimize globally. Requires reliable communication. Single point of failure.</p><p><strong>Decentralized:</strong> Each resource controller acts autonomously. Droop control: generator voltage droops slightly with load (lower voltage = higher load), naturally sharing load. Simple, robust, no communication needed. Less optimized than centralized.</p><p><strong>Hierarchical:</strong> Primary (local control), secondary (voltage/frequency regulation), tertiary (economic optimization). Combines benefits of centralized and decentralized.</p><h3>Islanding & Synchronization</h3><p>Microgrid separates from main grid during disturbance (intentional or unintentional islanding). Local generation must maintain frequency and voltage. Fast frequency response from storage (battery) or load shedding prevents blackout. Resynchronization after grid recovery requires frequency and phase matching (within 30° phase angle and <1% frequency).</p><h3>Energy Storage Integration</h3><p>Battery storage smooths renewable variability: absorbs excess solar/wind, supplies when generation low. Reduces need for expensive spinning reserve. Sized for 2-4 hours autonomy for typical microgrid. Fast response (milliseconds) helps stabilize frequency/voltage. Round-trip efficiency 85-95% for lithium batteries, 60-75% for lead-acid.</p></section><section id=losses><h2>Transmission & Distribution Losses</h2><h3>Copper Loss (I²R Loss)</h3><p>Power loss in conductor = I² × R where I is current, R is resistance. Resistance R = ρ × L / A where ρ is resistivity, L is length, A is cross-sectional area. Doubling voltage reduces current to half for same power: loss becomes 1/4. This is why high-voltage transmission: reduces current and quadratically reduces losses.</p><h3>AC Transmission Losses</h3><p>Typical 345 kV transmission line: 0.02-0.04 Ω/km. Current 500A over 100 km distance: I²R = 500² × 0.003 × 100 = 7.5 MW loss. Same power at 115 kV would require 3× current and 9× loss (67.5 MW). Modern transmission: 1-2% loss over typical distances. Distribution: 3-5% loss (lower voltage, higher current).</p><h3>Reactive Power Losses</h3><p>Inductive reactance X = 2πfL causes voltage drop (analogous to I²R loss but reactive). Apparent power S = √(P² + Q²) where Q is reactive power (VAR). Transmission line carrying high reactive power has large apparent power but low real power, increasing losses and requiring oversized conductors. Power factor correction (capacitor banks) reduces reactive power, improving efficiency.</p></section><section id=power-factor><h2>Power Factor Correction</h2><h3>Power Factor Definition</h3><p>Power factor = Real power / Apparent power = P / S = cos(φ) where φ is phase angle between voltage and current. Motors, inductors lag (current lags voltage, φ positive), capacitors lead. Most industrial loads lag; power factor typically 0.85-0.95. Utility charges penalty for low power factor (increases reactive power on distribution line).</p><h3>Capacitor Bank Correction</h3><p>Parallel capacitor bank at load draws current 90° ahead of voltage, canceling inductive load current. Capacitor size (µF) = (P × (tan φ₁ - tan φ₂)) / V² where P is watts, tan φ₁ is load angle, tan φ₂ is desired angle. A 100 kW motor at 0.8 power factor corrected to 0.95 needs: C = (100000 × 0.75 × (0.75 - 0.329)) / 480² ≈ 56 µF = 56 kVAR capacitor bank.</p><h3>Harmonic Distortion Caution</h3><p>Non-sinusoidal loads (variable frequency drives, switching power supplies) generate harmonic currents (multiples of fundamental 60 Hz). Harmonic-rich environment can cause capacitor resonance with load inductance, creating dangerous overvoltages. Use harmonic analysis before adding capacitors. Active harmonic filters can address distortion more effectively than passive capacitors.</p></section><section id=reliability><h2>System Reliability & Redundancy</h2><h3>Single vs Dual Feed Systems</h3><p><strong>Single feed:</strong> One feeder supplies load. Simple, cheap, but any fault disconnects customer. Typical residential and most commercial.</p><p><strong>Dual feed:</strong> Two independent feeders, normally connected through switchable impedance. Loss of one feeder: customer loads transfer to second feed without interruption. Used for critical facilities (hospitals, data centers). Cost 2× single feed but eliminates outages.</p><h3>N-1 Contingency Planning</h3><p>Grid designed to withstand loss of any single major component (largest generator, largest transmission line, transformer). After single-contingency loss, all remaining customers still served (possibly with reduced voltage or frequency temporarily). Requires extra generation and transmission capacity (typically 15-20% redundancy). Prevents cascading blackouts.</p><h3>System Resilience Metrics</h3><p>SAIFI (System Average Interruption Frequency Index): average number of interruptions per customer per year. SAIDI (System Average Interruption Duration Index): average duration of interruptions. Typical targets: SAIFI <2.0 (interruptions), SAIDI <60 minutes. Rural systems <1.0 SAIFI, 30 min SAIDI typical. Urban systems >2.0 SAIFI common.</p></section><div class=warning><strong>Safety Warning:</strong> Power distribution systems contain voltages lethal enough to stop your heart. Never work on distribution lines or transformers without proper training and equipment. Downed lines are always dangerous—assume every downed power line is energized. Three-phase systems can cause electrocution from unexpected contact while working de-energized single-phase circuits (energy stored in motor rotor fields or capacitor banks).</strong></div><div class=tip><strong>Design Tip:</strong> When distributing power through extended facility, minimize feeder length and maximize conductor size for critical loads. Every foot of extra feeder length costs money in losses and voltage drop. Use higher voltage distribution (480V vs 120V) to reduce current and losses by 16×.</div><div class=related role="navigation" aria-label="Related guides"><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href=electrical-motors.html>Electric Motors</a><a href=electrical-wiring.html>Electrical Wiring</a><a href=electrical-generation.html>Power Generation</a><a href=hydroelectric.html>Hydroelectric Systems</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium &mdash; Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
