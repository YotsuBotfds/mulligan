At anode (positive electrode): 2Cl⁻ → Cl₂↑ + 2e⁻. At cathode (negative electrode): 2H₂O + 2e⁻ → H₂↑ + 2OH⁻. Produced chlorine can be absorbed in base solution forming hypochlorite: Cl₂ + 2OH⁻ → Cl⁻ + OCl⁻ + H₂O.</p><p>Chlorine gas (Cl₂) is yellow-green, toxic, heavier than air (2.5x). Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is the active ingredient in bleach - soluble, safer to handle, effective disinfectant. Both kill pathogens by oxidizing cellular proteins and disrupting cell membranes.</p></section><section id="cell-design"><h2>Electrolytic Cell Design</h2><p>Electrolytic cells convert electrical energy to chemical production through forced redox reaction.</p><h3>Materials Selection</h3><p><strong>Anode (positive electrode):</strong> Must resist chlorine corrosion. Options: (1) graphite rod/plate (carbon) - resistant, inexpensive, becomes anodic corrosion product over time (replaced annually), (2) dimensionally stable anode (DSA) - titanium coated with mixed metal oxides (iridium/ruthenium) - expensive but lasts 10+ years, (3) platinum - extremely expensive but inert. For survival systems, graphite acceptable despite replacement needs.</p><p><strong>Cathode (negative electrode):</strong> Must resist caustic base. Options: (1) steel - acceptable, gradually corrodes (replaced every 2-3 years), (2) stainless steel (316L) - much better corrosion resistance, (3) nickel-coated steel - good balance. For small systems, steel acceptable.</p><p><strong>Cell container:</strong> Must resist chlorine AND caustic base. Materials: (1) PVC plastic (polyvinyl chloride) - resists both chlorine gas and NaOH, temperature limit <60°C, (2) polypropylene (PP) - good resistance, temperature limit <50°C, (3) ceramics/porcelain - excellent but brittle, (4) glass-lined steel - excellent but expensive. For DIY systems, food-grade PVC acceptable.</p><h3>Cell Configuration</h3><p>Simple configuration: two electrodes (anode/cathode) submerged in saltwater brine solution in plastic container. Electrodes separated by 5-10cm (reducing distance increases current efficiency but heat generation). Connect to DC power source (12V battery, solar panel, or dedicated power supply).</p><p>Separator (optional): porous membrane between electrodes prevents mixing of chlorine (anode) and hydrogen (cathode) - safety concern. Using diaphragm (porous ceramic or asbestos cloth historically, now replaced with permion/nafion membranes) improves safety and prevents back-reaction. DIY systems often omit separator - must ensure tight gas collection to prevent mixing.</p></section><section id="chlorine-gas"><h2>Chlorine Gas Production</h2><p>Direct electrolysis produces Cl₂ gas at anode. Must be contained, collected, or immediately reacted with base.</p><h3>Production Rate</h3><p>Faraday's Law: moles of Cl₂ = (current in amps × time in seconds) / (2 × 96,485 coulombs/mole). Practically: 1 amp produces ~0.37 grams Cl₂ per hour. A 10-amp cell produces 3.7g/hour = 89g/day = ~200L gas/day (at STP) = sufficient to disinfect 40,000-200,000 liters water depending on contamination level.</p><h3>Collection Methods</h3><p><strong>Gas bag collection:</strong> Direct gas outlet from cell into gas-tight bag (HDPE plastic preferred, not PVC which chlorine attacks). Disadvantage: difficult to control flow, chlorine may escape if pressure builds. Use for intermittent collection only.</p><p><strong>Displacement absorption:</strong> Pipe cell outlet into water/base solution. Chlorine bubbles through and dissolves. Controlled reaction, no gas escapes. This IS direct hypochlorite production (see next section). Most practical method.</p><p><strong>Scrubbing tower:</strong> Chlorine passes through packed column of caustic solution (sodium hydroxide or lime water). Cl₂ + 2OH⁻ → OCl⁻ + Cl⁻ + H₂O. Removes chlorine from gas stream, produces liquid hypochlorite. Uses: (1) safety (no gas release), (2) chemical production simultaneously. Complexity: requires pump circulation and heat management.</p><div class="warning"><strong>CRITICAL: Chlorine is deadly.</strong> Cl₂ is 2.5x heavier than air, sinks to ground level, accumulates in low areas. Inhaling 10 ppm for minutes causes coughing; 100 ppm causes respiratory distress within minutes; 400+ ppm is fatal within 30 minutes. Symptoms: chest tightness, coughing, burning eyes/nose/throat. No antidote - treatment is oxygen and supportive care. NEVER deliberately produce chlorine gas without fully enclosed system and proper ventilation. Gas MUST be either contained in sealed vessel for use or immediately reacted with base solution.</div></section><section id="hypochlorite"><h2>Sodium Hypochlorite Production</h2><p>Safest method combines chlorine production with immediate absorption in base solution, creating bleach (sodium hypochlorite).</p><h3>Procedure</h3><ol><li><strong>Prepare brine:</strong> Dissolve 300g NaCl (table salt) in 1 liter water. Saturated solution optimal (maintains conductivity throughout electrolysis as salt depletes)<li><strong>Prepare base solution:</strong> Dissolve 50g NaOH (caustic soda) in 1 liter water. Caustic hydroxide absorbs chlorine: Cl₂ + 2OH⁻ → OCl⁻ + Cl⁻ + H₂O<li><strong>Setup:</strong> Place brine in cell container with electrodes. Connect cell to 12V DC power supply (car battery, solar charger, or regulated power supply). Start electrolysis at 5-10 amps<li><strong>Chlorine absorption:</strong> Pipe cell outlet gas tube into caustic solution bottle, with gas tube ending submerged 5-10cm below surface. Gas bubbles through, chlorine dissolves immediately. Yellow-green color fades as gas absorbed (good sign - chlorine being converted)<li><strong>Monitor:</strong> Solution gradually becomes yellow/orange as hypochlorite forms. Cell will warm as current flows - maintain <50°C (ice bath or cooling coil around cell if needed)<li><strong>Run time:</strong> Continue 1-4 hours per batch. Stop when cell voltage rises above input voltage (indicates salt depletion). Cool before opening, then replace brine, repeat</ol><h3>Reaction Chemistry</h3><p>At anode (positive): 2Cl⁻ → Cl₂↑ + 2e⁻ | At cathode (negative): 2H₂O + 2e⁻ → H₂↑ + 2OH⁻ | Overall: 2NaCl + 2H₂O → Cl₂↑ + H₂↑ + 2NaOH (if separated). Combined with absorption: Cl₂ + 2NaOH → NaOCl + NaCl + H₂O (in base solution).</p></section><section id="concentration"><h2>Concentration Testing</h3><p>Bleach effectiveness depends on active chlorine concentration. Commercial laundry bleach is typically 3-6% NaOCl. For water treatment, 0.5-2 ppm is lethal to most pathogens.</p><h3>Iodine Titration Method</h3><p>Measure available chlorine using potassium iodide + starch indicator:</p><ol><li>Dilute sample: 10 mL bleach + 90 mL water (assume 5% concentrate; adjust if weaker)<li>Add 10 mL potassium iodide solution (KI, 5% concentration)<li>Add 10 mL acetic acid (vinegar acceptable)<li>Color develops: yellow indicates iodine release (reaction: OCl⁻ + 2I⁻ + 2H⁺ → I₂ + Cl⁻ + H₂O)<li>Add starch solution (few drops) - solution turns blue if chlorine present (I₂ + starch → blue complex)<li>Titrate with sodium thiosulfate (Na₂S₂O₃) standard until blue fades to clear<li>Calculate: (mL thiosulfate × thiosulfate concentration) / sample volume = % available chlorine</ol><p>Alternatively, use commercial test strips (chlorine indicator paper) - change color with concentration. Less accurate but simple field method.</p><h3>Target Concentrations</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Application<th scope="row">Target Concentration<th scope="row">Amount per 1000L Water<th scope="row">Contact Time<tr><td>Drinking water<td>0.5-1.0 ppm<td>1-2 mL of 5% bleach<td>30 min minimum<tr><td>Wound irrigation<td>0.5% solution<td>N/A (topical use)<td>5-10 min<tr><td>Surface disinfection<td>1-10% bleach<td>N/A (direct application)<td>10-15 min<tr><td>Laundry (disinfection)<td>200-500 ppm<td>200-500 mL per full load<td>Mix in wash water</table></section><section id="storage"><h2>Storage and Stability</h2><p>Sodium hypochlorite (bleach) is chemically unstable and gradually loses potency. Proper storage extends usable life.</p><h3>Storage Conditions</h3><p><strong>Temperature:</strong> Cool is critical - each 10°C increase halves shelf life. Store at 5-15°C if possible. At 20°C (room temp), 3-6 month lifespan. At 40°C (warm), 1-2 month lifespan. Refrigeration extends to 1+ year.</p><p><strong>Light:</strong> UV causes decomposition. Store in opaque containers (dark plastic, painted bottles, or in dark cabinet). Transparent bottles reduce shelf life by 50%.</p><p><strong>Container material:</strong> Use high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic or glass. AVOID: aluminum (reacts with alkaline bleach), zinc galvanized (corrodes), copper/brass (corrodes). Plastic prevents light penetration better than glass.</p><p><strong>Seal:</strong> Keep tightly sealed - oxygen and CO₂ exposure accelerates decomposition. Every time opened, some potency lost. Use only to fill small working bottles; keep large stock sealed.</p><h3>Stabilization</h3><p>Add sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃, washing soda) to reduce decomposition. 0.5% Na₂CO₃ by weight increases shelf life 2-3x. Dissolve 5g Na₂CO₃ per liter of bleach. Slightly increases pH (makes more stable, slightly reduces effectiveness at very low concentrations, but not material for water treatment doses).</p></section><section id="decomposition"><h2>Decomposition Prevention</h2><p>Hypochlorite decomposes via: 2OCl⁻ → 2Cl⁻ + O₂↑ (loss of available chlorine). Multiple factors accelerate.</p><h3>Degradation Factors</h3><p><strong>Heat:</strong> Most significant factor. 25°C vs. 50°C increases decomposition rate 5x. Maintenance <15°C critical for long storage.</p><p><strong>Sunlight/UV:</strong> Direct light causes rapid decomposition. Keep away from windows, use opaque storage containers.</p><p><strong>Metals (iron, copper, manganese, nickel):</strong> Catalyze decomposition. Even traces (ppm level) accelerate loss. Use only plastic or glass containers. Filter water before treating if rusty/metallic taste (indicates dissolved metals).</p><p><strong>Ammonia contamination:</strong> Reacts to form chloramines: OCl⁻ + NH₄⁺ → HOCl + NH₂Cl (less effective disinfectant). Avoid ammonia-containing cleaners near bleach. Well water containing ammonia (ammonium) should be treated differently (breakpoint chlorination needed).</p><p><strong>Low pH:</strong> Below pH 6, hypochlorite converts to unstable hypochlorous acid. Maintain pH 7-8 with sodium carbonate or baking soda addition.</p><h3>Testing for Potency Loss</h3><p>If storage longer than 3-6 months: test before using for critical applications. Iodine titration (method described above) gives quantitative result. Color indication: fresh bleach is pale yellow; faded/clear indicates potency loss. Dilute test: 10mL bleach + 90mL water. Still strong yellow = adequate; pale = weakening; clear = depleted.</p><p>Rule of thumb: assume 20-30% potency loss per year at room temperature. Production and frequent testing preferred over storage for long-term reliability.</p></section><section id="applications"><h2>Water Treatment Applications</h2><p>Bleach is powerful disinfectant for pathogens (bacteria, viruses, some protozoa). Does NOT remove turbidity, colors, taste, or chemical contaminants.</p><h3>Disinfection Procedure</h3><ol><li><strong>Pre-filter:</strong> Remove particles/turbidity using cloth, sand filter, or settling (turbidity reduces chlorine effectiveness and protects microbes)<li><strong>Measure:</strong> Calculate volume to be treated<li><strong>Dose:</strong> Add bleach at rate 0.5-2 ppm (typically 1-2 mL per 1000L of 5% bleach for typical well/surface water)<li><strong>Mix:</strong> Stir thoroughly for 2-3 minutes<li><strong>Contact time:</strong> Wait minimum 30 minutes before using. Longer is safer - 1-2 hours ideal. Chlorine kills bacteria gradually; longer wait ensures complete kill<li><strong>Verify:</strong> Test residual chlorine - should be 0.2-0.5 ppm remaining after contact time. Indicates adequate dosing and buffer for pipe microbes</ol><h3>Effectiveness</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Pathogen<th scope="row">Sensitivity<th scope="row">Dose for Kill<th scope="row">Time for 99% Kill<tr><td>E. coli (bacteria)<td>Very High<td>0.5 ppm Cl₂<td>2 minutes at pH 7<tr><td>Cholera (bacteria)<td>Very High<td>0.5 ppm<td>1 minute<tr><td>Typhoid (bacteria)<td>High<td>1 ppm<td>5 minutes<tr><td>Hepatitis A (virus)<td>Moderate<td>2-3 ppm<td>30 minutes at pH 7<tr><td>Giardia cysts<td>Low<td>5+ ppm<td>60+ minutes (partial)<tr><td>Cryptosporidium<td>Resistant<td>Not effective<td>Not killed (needs filtration/boiling)</table><p>Effectiveness reduced by: (1) high turbidity (particles shield microbes), (2) low pH <6 (use soda ash to raise), (3) organic matter (chlorine consumed oxidizing organics, not killing pathogens), (4) low temperature <5°C (reactions slow), (5) short contact time.</p></section><section id="safety"><h2>Critical Safety Warnings</h2><ul><li><strong>Chlorine gas is deadly.</strong> 10 ppm causes eye irritation within minutes. 100 ppm causes respiratory damage. 1000 ppm is fatal. NEVER deliberately produce chlorine gas for storage or transport. Only produce when immediately absorbed in solution or fully sealed collection system with proper ventilation<li><strong>Hydrogen gas is flammable.</strong> Cathode produces H₂ simultaneously with Cl₂. If separated (using diaphragm), hydrogen accumulates. Mixture of 5-15% H₂ in air is explosive. Avoid ignition sources near cell venting. Cl₂ + H₂ can react explosively if ignited<li><strong>Never mix chlorine with ammonia or other chemicals.</strong> Chloramine gas (Cl₂ + NH₃) is even more toxic than pure chlorine. Hydrochloric acid + chlorine produces phosgene (WWII chemical weapon - instantly lethal). Acetone + bleach produces chloroform. Isopropanol + bleach produces acetone + chlorine<li><strong>Corrosive solution.</strong> Caustic soda solution is corrosive - wear gloves, goggles, apron. Any splash to skin or eyes requires immediate water irrigation 15 minutes minimum, then medical care<li><strong>Electrical hazard.</strong> Electrolytic cells operate on high current. Risk of electrical shock if proper isolation not maintained. Use properly grounded equipment, ground fault interrupter (GFI) circuits, insulated tools only<li><strong>Do NOT transport or store chlorine gas.</strong> Gas containment extremely difficult. Any leak is dangerous and uncontrollable. Only store as liquid bleach (sodium hypochlorite). Keep bleach in sealed, opaque, cool storage<li><strong>Health impacts of overexposure.</strong> Chronic low-level chlorine exposure (working in poor ventilation) causes reactive airway disease, asthma, chronic bronchitis. Acute high-level exposure can damage lungs permanently. Proper ventilation is not luxury - is necessity</ul><div class="warning"><strong>FINAL WARNING: Chlorine gas production is extremely hazardous and NOT RECOMMENDED for amateur chemists.</strong> If chlorine water disinfection needed in survival scenario: (1) use purchased bleach stored properly, or (2) boil water for 10 minutes (fuel-intensive but eliminates all biological hazards), or (3) use iodine tablets (less ideal but vastly safer than DIY electrolysis). Only attempt electrolytic bleach production if: (1) you have professional chemical training, (2) proper ventilation/venting to outside, (3) spill containment, (4) first aid trained, (5) emergency response plan. Otherwise, use other disinfection methods.</div></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="chemical-safety.html">Chemical Safety</a> | <a href="water-purification.html">Water Purification</a> | <a href="sanitation.html">Sanitation Systems</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
