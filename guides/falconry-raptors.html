A trained raptor can secure 2-5 pieces of quarry per hunting session, with minimal ammunition expenditure compared to firearms. This makes falconry particularly valuable when ammunition is scarce or rationed. The training investment pays dividends over months or years of consistent hunting.</p></section><section id=species-selection><h2>Species Selection</h2><p><strong>Harris's Hawk:</strong> Best for beginners. Naturally social and cooperative hunters in the wild, weighing 700-1200g. They adapt well to training and work well in pairs or teams.</p><p><strong>Red-Tailed Hawk:</strong> Large, powerful, and capable in varied terrain. Weight ranges 900-1500g. Excellent all-purpose raptor for diverse hunting environments.</p><p><strong>Goshawk:</strong> Forest specialist, highly aggressive and effective in wooded areas. Weight 500-1200g. Difficult temperament requires experienced handlers.</p><p><strong>Peregrine Falcon:</strong> Specialized bird-hunter capable of speeds exceeding 300 km/h. Best for open terrain hunting. Requires open ground and high-flying capability.</p></section><section id=trapping><h2>Trapping Wild Raptors</h2><p>The bal-chatri trap (a small pigeon crate with snares) and bow nets are effective for capturing passage juveniles—young birds migrating for the first time, which have not yet learned survival skills. Initial capture requires quiet handling with a hood applied immediately to calm the bird. Keep stress minimal during the first handling to avoid injury from panic.</p><p>Passage birds (late summer to early fall) are ideal first hawks, as they lack ingrained wild behaviors and adapt more readily to captivity and training than adult birds.</p></section><section id=training-fundamentals><h2>Training Fundamentals</h2><p><strong>Manning:</strong> Allow 1-3 weeks for the bird to become accustomed to human presence. Start with quiet observation and minimal interaction.</p><p><strong>Weight Management:</strong> Maintain the bird at 85-95% of its natural free-feeding weight. This is critical—overweight birds lack motivation, underweight birds become dangerous and stressed.</p><p><strong>Recall Training:</strong> Start at close range (1 meter) with food rewards, gradually extending to 100+ meters. Use a whistle or verbal cue consistently. The bird must associate the signal with reward reliably.</p><p><strong>Quarry Introduction:</strong> Introduce live prey only after solid recall and basic obedience. Start with easy prey like pigeons or rabbits in controlled settings.</p></section><section id=equipment><h2>Equipment (Field-Craftable)</h2><p><strong>Glove:</strong> Double-layer leather, fitted to protect the forearm from talons. Essential for safe handling.</p><p><strong>Jesses:</strong> Leather leg strips attached to the bird's legs, allowing you to tether and control the bird during training and rest periods.</p><p><strong>Hood:</strong> Covers the bird's eyes to keep it calm and focused. Can be crafted from soft leather with proper ventilation holes.</p><p><strong>Perch:</strong> Bow-shaped perch for hawks; block perch for falcons. Should allow comfortable standing without stress to feet.</p><p><strong>Bells:</strong> Attached to the bird's tail or legs for tracking in dense vegetation. Audible from 100+ meters away.</p></section><section id=hunting-practice><h2>Hunting Practice</h2><p>Successful hunting requires matching habitat to species capability. Scout terrain before hunts. Work with one hunter flushing game while the other manages the bird. Share quarry—never let the bird gorge alone, as this promotes independence from training.</p><p>Daily limits: Hunt 2-3 hours per session, 3-5 days per week. More frequent hunting can exhaust the bird and damage your training investment. Allow rest days for recovery and bonding.</p><p>Record successful flights and quarry in a log. This data helps refine your technique and understand seasonal patterns in your hunting area.</p></section><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium &mdash; Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
