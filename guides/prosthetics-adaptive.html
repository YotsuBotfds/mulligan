Philosophy of Adaptive Care </h2><h3> The Human Right to Function </h3><p> Amputation, paralysis, blindness, and deafness need not mean the end of productive life. Throughout history, disabled individuals have adapted, innovated, and contributed meaningfully to their communities. The philosophy of adaptive care rests on three pillars: <strong> restoring functional capacity, preventing psychological despair, and recognizing that every person has value and can contribute. </strong></p><h3> Quality of Life After Injury </h3><p> A prosthetic limb is not merely a replacement for the lost limb—it is a tool for psychological healing. When a person can walk again, work again, or hold their child again, they reclaim agency and dignity. The goal is not perfection but functionality and independence at the highest level the individual can achieve. Many users report that mastering adaptive equipment provides a profound sense of accomplishment and control over their circumstances. </p><h3> Preventing Despair: Purpose and Contribution </h3><p> Depression and despair following major trauma are as real as the physical injury. However, studies consistently show that individuals who engage in rehabilitation—especially when they can see progress and return to meaningful activity—experience better mental health outcomes. The act of learning to use a prosthetic, mastering a new way to work, or adapting hobbies sends a powerful psychological message: "I can still do things. I still matter." </p><h3> Historical Precedents and Innovation </h3><h4> Pirates and Practical Adaptation </h4><p> Maritime cultures developed some of the earliest practical prosthetics. Sailors with lost limbs fashioned wooden replacements, which eventually became iconic (hence the "peg leg"). While crude by modern standards, these devices allowed amputation survivors to return to sea and productive work. The peg leg was not fancy, but it worked. This principle—functionality over aesthetics—remains central to developing countries and resource-limited settings today. </p><h4> American Civil War Advances (1861-1865) </h4><p> The American Civil War produced tens of thousands of amputees. The scale of injury forced rapid innovation in prosthetic design. The U.S. government funded development of articulated prosthetics with joints and springs, patented wooden feet with articulated ankles, and leather harnesses that distributed load more effectively. Many techniques developed during this period remained standard for over a century. Veterans' needs drove engineering progress. </p><h4> World War I Prosthetists (1914-1918) </h4><p> WWI produced unprecedented numbers of disabled servicemen. Professional prosthetists became a recognized discipline. Harnesses improved, aluminum began to replace wood, and the concept of custom-fitting prosthetics emerged. Officers coordinated rehabilitation programs that combined physical therapy with psychological support and vocational training. The war demonstrated that amputees could return to civilian employment when properly supported. </p><h3> Modern Principles </h3><p> Today's approach to adaptive devices follows principles learned over centuries: </p><ul><li><strong> Custom fit: </strong> Off-the-shelf solutions rarely work. Each person's body is unique. </li><li><strong> Iterative improvement: </strong> The first prosthetic is rarely the final version. Adjustments, refinement, and experimentation are essential. </li><li><strong> User training: </strong> Equipment is only as good as the person's ability to use it. Therapy, instruction, and practice are critical. </li><li><strong> Psychological support: </strong> Physical rehabilitation without mental health support often fails. </li><li><strong> Return to purpose: </strong> Devices should enable the specific activities that matter to the individual—whether work, family, or recreation. </li><li><strong> Community: </strong> Peer support from others who have adapted is invaluable. </li></ul></section><section id="crutches"><h2> 2. Crutches & Walking Aids </h2><h3> Axillary Crutch (Underarm Crutch) </h3><p> The simplest crutch begins with a forked branch or carefully selected piece of wood that provides an underarm support. This is one of humanity's oldest mobility aids—still used across the world where manufactured crutches are unavailable. </p><h4> Construction from Wood </h4><div class="spec-box"><strong> Materials: </strong> Straight hardwood or light wood (hickory, ash, or similar); natural fork or wood carved into Y-shape <br><br><strong> Dimensions: </strong><ul><li> Total length: Measured from floor to 2 inches below armpit when standing (typically 52-56 inches for adults) </li><li> Underarm pad diameter: 4-5 inches, positioned 2 inches below top </li><li> Hand grip position: 8-10 inches from bottom, at height where elbow bends at 20-30 degrees </li><li> Diameter of shaft: 1.5-2 inches (thick enough to support full body weight without bending) </li></ul><br><strong> Padding: </strong> Wrap underarm contact point with wool felt (1-2 inches thick) glued and stitched to wood, then cover with soft leather. This prevents nerve compression and bruising. </div><h4> Proper Use and Safety </h4><ul><li> Weight should rest primarily on hands and arms, not axilla (underarm). Pressure on nerves causes nerve damage. </li><li> User leans slightly forward, moving crutches and injured leg together, then advances uninjured leg. </li><li> Inspect padding weekly; replace if compressed or worn. </li></ul><h3> Forearm Crutch (Canadian or Lofstrand Crutch) </h3><p> For longer-term use or permanent disability, forearm crutches are more comfortable than underarm crutches. They distribute weight through the forearm, avoiding nerve compression. </p><div class="spec-box"><strong> Construction: </strong><ul><li> Vertical shaft: Hardwood or metal tube, 36-44 inches long </li><li> Forearm cuff: Leather or fabric sleeve, 3-4 inches wide, positioned 3-4 inches below hand grip </li><li> Hand grip: Wooden dowel or carved wood handle, positioned at wrist height when standing with arms at sides </li><li> Cuff attachment: Bolted or riveted to allow some rotation but remain secure </li></ul><br><strong> Weight distribution: </strong> Approximately 40% through forearm cuff, 60% through hand grip. </div><h3> Walking Stick (Cane) </h3><p> For those with one functional leg or partial weakness, a single walking stick provides balance support and distributes some weight away from the injured side. </p><div class="spec-box"><strong> Specifications: </strong><ul><li> Length: Measured from floor to wrist crease when standing with arm relaxed (typically 32-36 inches) </li><li> Shaft diameter: 1-1.5 inches for comfort and adequate strength </li><li> Handle: Wooden hook or L-shape, curved to fit palm </li><li> Tip: Rubber or leather ferrule to prevent slipping (or point wedged with metal if on rough terrain) </li><li> Weight: Hardwood is sufficient; lighter wood (like pine) is suitable </li></ul><br><strong> Gait: </strong> Cane advances with injured leg; user bears less weight on injured side. </div><h3> Walker Frame </h3><p> For those with significant leg weakness, paralysis, or balance problems, a rectangular frame walker provides front and side support. </p><div class="spec-box"><strong> Dimensions (adult): </strong><ul><li> Width: 26-28 inches (slightly narrower than shoulders) </li><li> Depth: 12-14 inches (clears feet during walking) </li><li> Height: Set so user's wrist is at grip level when standing (typically 36-40 inches) </li><li> Frame material: Lightweight wood (ash, pine) or metal tube (steel or aluminum preferred) </li><li> Grip diameter: 1-1.25 inches </li></ul><br><strong> Variants: </strong><ul><li><em> Folding frame: </em> Hinged sides allow compact storage </li><li><em> Rolling walker: </em> Wheels on front legs, glides more easily but less control </li><li><em> Wheeled walker with brakes: </em> Wheels + hand brakes for those who lack lifting strength </li></ul></div><h3> Gait Patterns </h3><table><tr><th scope="row"> Gait Pattern </th><th scope="row"> Indications </th><th scope="row"> Sequence </th></tr><tr><td> Two-point </td><td> One weak/injured leg </td><td> Crutch + opposite leg together, then other leg </td></tr><tr><td> Three-point </td><td> Cannot bear weight on one leg </td><td> Both crutches + injured leg, then uninjured leg forward </td></tr><tr><td> Four-point </td><td> Balance problems, needs stability </td><td> Right crutch, left leg, left crutch, right leg (alternating) </td></tr></table></section><section id="wheelchair"><h2> 3. Wheelchair Construction </h2><h3> Basic Wood-Frame Wheelchair </h3><p> A functional wheelchair can be constructed from wood, leather, and large wheels salvaged from bicycles or hand-made from solid wood. This is essential knowledge for resource-limited settings. </p><h4> Frame Construction </h4><div class="spec-box"><strong> Main frame material: </strong> Hardwood (hickory, oak, maple) or lightweight ash for reduced weight <br><br><strong> Dimensions (adult): </strong><ul><li> Seat height: 18-20 inches from ground (allows thigh to be parallel to ground when seated) </li><li> Seat width: 16-18 inches (measured at hips) </li><li> Seat depth: 16-18 inches (support thighs without pressing on back of knees) </li><li> Overall width at wheels: 26-28 inches </li><li> Overall height: 32-36 inches to wheelchair back </li><li> Footrest height: 16-17 inches (supports feet at 90-degree ankle angle) </li></ul></div><h4> Wheel Specifications and Axle Placement </h4><div class="spec-box"><strong> Rear wheels (large): </strong><ul><li> Diameter: 24-26 inches (12-inch radius) </li><li> Construction: Bicycle wheels are simplest; alternatively carve solid wood discs and bind with steel bands </li><li> Tread: Bicycle tire (if available) or wrapped cloth/leather for grip </li><li> Axle placement: 3-4 inches forward of seat back; affects maneuverability and tip-back stability </li></ul><br><strong> Front wheels (small casters): </strong><ul><li> Diameter: 6-8 inches </li><li> Purpose: Directional control and shock absorption </li><li> Swivel: Must rotate freely; use leather bearing if metal bearings unavailable </li></ul></div><h4> Seat and Back Support </h4><div class="spec-box"><strong> Seat material: </strong> Woven canvas or heavy leather stretched across wooden frame <br><br><strong> Back support: </strong> Angled 15-20 degrees from vertical; height 12-16 inches above seat surface <br><br><strong> Armrests: </strong> Height 8-10 inches above seat; removable or fold-down for transfers; cushioned with leather-covered wool padding </div><h3> Terrain Considerations </h3><ul><li><strong> Smooth floors: </strong> Narrow wheelbase (24-26 inches) is maneuverable; smaller casters acceptable </li><li><strong> Outdoor/rough terrain: </strong> Wider wheelbase improves stability; larger casters reduce tip-forward on bumps; increased wheel diameter allows rolling over obstacles </li><li><strong> Stairs: </strong> Requires 1-2 assistants to tilt on rear wheels and bump up steps; alternative is ramps </li></ul><h3> Lightweight vs. Strong: Material Trade-offs </h3><table><tr><th scope="row"> Material </th><th scope="row"> Weight </th><th scope="row"> Strength </th><th scope="row"> Best For </th></tr><tr><td> Ash wood </td><td> 5-7 lbs </td><td> Excellent </td><td> Lightweight, user-propelled, long distance </td></tr><tr><td> Oak/Maple </td><td> 8-12 lbs </td><td> Superior </td><td> Heavy use, outdoor terrain, durability </td></tr><tr><td> Pine </td><td> 4-6 lbs </td><td> Adequate </td><td> Light use, temporary, cost-effective </td></tr><tr><td> Metal tube (steel) </td><td> 6-10 lbs </td><td> Excellent </td><td> High-impact use, durability, longevity </td></tr></table><h3> Propulsion Methods </h3><ul><li><strong> Hand-propelled: </strong> User grips rear wheels with push rings and propels wheelchair forward.

Removable armrests and footrests allow sideways transfers. Seat height at 18-20 inches should align with standard beds (24-26 inches) and toilet seats for safe, low-stress movement. </p></section><section id="prosthetic-legs"><h2> 4. Prosthetic Legs </h2><h3> The Peg Leg: Simplest Prosthetic </h3><p> A peg leg is a wooden cylinder fitted with a socket at the top (for the stump) and possibly a leather foot covering at the bottom. Despite its simplicity, it provides surprising functionality for standing and walking. </p><div class="spec-box"><strong> Construction: </strong><ul><li> Material: Hardwood (oak, hickory); single piece or laminated layers </li><li> Length: Typically 2-4 inches shorter than lost leg (amputees walk with a slight lean or limp) </li><li> Diameter: 3-4 inches at widest point </li><li> Shape: Tapered slightly from socket to foot; rounded bottom to allow rocking motion </li><li> Weight: 2-4 lbs (heavier than modern prosthetics but acceptable for activities) </li></ul></div><h3> Socket Fitting: Critical to Success </h3><p> The socket is where the prosthetic attaches to the residual limb (stump). Poor fit causes pain, skin breakdown, and abandonment of the device. A well-fitted socket is essential. </p><div class="spec-box"><strong> Casting the Socket: </strong><ul><li> Have the user stand on a soft material (sand, clay, or soft wood shavings) or use a plaster cast of the stump </li><li> Transfer the impression to wood or leather </li><li> Socket should contact stump surface with even pressure </li></ul><br><strong> Padding materials: </strong><ul><li><em> Wool felt: </em> 0.5-1 inch thick, glued directly to socket interior; absorbs moisture and cushions </li><li><em> Leather lining: </em> Wrapped over felt; durable and shaped to fit stump contours </li><li><em> Leather cup: </em> Custom-formed leather covering that encloses socket; allows adjustment via straps </li></ul></div><h3> Harness and Suspension </h3><div class="spec-box"><strong> Strap harness (for below-knee prosthetic): </strong><ul><li> Wide leather band (2-3 inches) encircles thigh just above knee </li><li> Attached to socket with two vertical leather straps </li><li> Buckles or laces allow snug adjustment </li><li> Purpose: Keeps socket from slipping; distributes pressure across larger area </li></ul><br><strong> Above-knee suspension: </strong><ul><li> Uses waist belt or diagonal suspension (strap over opposite shoulder) </li><li> Prevents hip drop and maintains socket position during swing phase of walking </li></ul></div><h3> Below-Knee Prosthetic with Foot Piece </h3><p> For amputation below the knee, a prosthetic with an articulated ankle and foot provides a more natural gait than a simple peg leg. </p><div class="spec-box"><strong> Components: </strong><ul><li><strong> Socket: </strong> As described above; sits on top of residual leg </li><li><strong> Shank (tibia replacement): </strong> Wooden shaft, slightly curved forward; 14-16 inches long (matches opposite leg) </li><li><strong> Ankle joint: </strong> Simple hinge or pivot point; allows forward/backward flex (dorsiflexion/plantarflexion) </li><li><strong> Foot: </strong> Wooden form shaped like natural foot, or leather-covered wood; typically 8-10 inches long </li><li><strong> Sole: </strong> Leather or canvas, with heel 0.5-1 inch higher than toe </li></ul></div><div class="diagram" role="figure" aria-label="Diagram"><h4> Below-Knee Prosthetic Diagram </h4><svg height="500" viewbox='0 0 300 600' width="250" aria-label='Prosthetics, Mobility Aids & Adaptive Devices diagram 1'><rect fill="#d4a574" height="100" stroke="#333" stroke-width="2" width="60" x="120" y="20"></rect><text fill="#333" font-size="12" text-anchor="middle" x="150" y="80"> Residual Leg </text><ellipse cx="150" cy="130" fill="#8b7355" rx="35" ry="25" stroke="#333" stroke-width="2"></ellipse><path d='M 115 130 L 110 160 L 190 160 L 185 130' fill="#a0826d" stroke="#333" stroke-width="2"></path><text fill="#fff" font-size="11" text-anchor="middle" x="150" y="150"> Socket </text><path d='M 130 160 Q 125 280 135 380' fill="none" stroke="#8b4513" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-width="25"></path><text fill="#fff" font-size="11" x="100" y="270"> Shank </text><circle cx="138" cy="385" fill="#666" r="12" stroke="#333" stroke-width="2"></circle><text fill="#aaa" font-size="11" x="170" y="390"> Ankle Joint </text><ellipse cx="160" cy="450" fill="#704214" rx="50" ry="30" stroke="#333" stroke-width="2"></ellipse><text fill="#fff" font-size="11" text-anchor="middle" x="160" y="455"> Foot </text><rect fill="#d4a574" height="60" stroke="#333" stroke-width="1" width="15" x="105" y="110"></rect><rect fill="#d4a574" height="60" stroke="#333" stroke-width="1" width="15" x="180" y="110"></rect><text fill="#aaa" font-size="10" x="170" y="100"> Harness </text><line stroke="#e94560" stroke-dasharray="5,5" stroke-width="1" x1="230" x2="230" y1="160" y2="380"></line><text fill="#e94560" font-size="10" x="235" y="270"> ~14-16" </text><line stroke="#e94560" stroke-dasharray="5,5" stroke-width="1" x1="230" x2="230" y1="380" y2="470"></line><text fill="#e94560" font-size="10" x="235" y="430"> ~8-10" </text></svg></div><h3> Above-Knee Prosthetic with Knee Joint </h3><p> For amputation above the knee, restoring the knee joint is critical for natural gait. Prosthetic knees range from simple hinges to complex mechanisms. </p><h4> Simple Hinged Knee (Most Practical for Limited Resources) </h4><div class="spec-box"><strong> Construction: </strong><ul><li><strong> Socket: </strong> Attaches to thigh; typically molded around hip and groin for stability </li><li><strong> Knee joint: </strong> Metal hinge (bolt through wood) or leather joint; allows 0-120 degrees of bending </li><li><strong> Shank: </strong> Wooden piece connecting knee to foot; 14-16 inches long </li><li><strong> Foot: </strong> Same as below-knee prosthetic </li><li><strong> Lockable knee: </strong> Detent mechanism or simple friction lock for standing stability </li></ul><br><strong> Weight distribution: </strong> Socket bears most weight. Knee joint must be robust (expect 2-3x body weight through knee during walking). </div><h4> Lockable vs. Free Knee </h4><p><strong> Locked knee: </strong> Foot and shank form a rigid extension when weight is on prosthesis. Easier to stand and walk (especially for weak users). Requires deliberate unlocking and bending for sitting or stairs. </p><p><strong> Free knee: </strong> Bends passively when not bearing weight. Allows more natural sitting and stair climbing but requires more muscle control and balance. </p><h3> Prosthetic Alignment </h3><p> The position and angle of the prosthetic components critically affects gait and comfort. </p><div class="spec-box"><strong> Socket rotation: </strong> Socket can be internally rotated (toe-in) or externally rotated (toe-out). User's preference and standing/walking mechanics guide alignment. <br><br><strong> Heel height: </strong> Prosthetic foot sole heel should be 0.5-1 inch higher than toe. This promotes calf muscle action during push-off and provides a more natural gait. <br><br><strong> Shank alignment: </strong> Slight forward bend (flexion) of knee when walking promotes natural swing and reduces hip hiking. </div><h3> Gait Training After Prosthetic Fitting </h3><ul><li> User begins by standing with support, getting accustomed to weight and balance. </li><li> Progress to weight-shifting (side to side, forward and back). </li><li> Transition to walking with parallel bars or crutches for support. </li><li> Graduate to walking without supports as balance and confidence improve. </li><li> Advanced activities: stairs, slopes, uneven terrain. </li><li> Typical timeline: weeks to months, depending on age, motivation, and overall health. </li></ul></section><section id="prosthetic-arms"><h2> 5.

The trauma of disability triggers complex emotional responses that must be addressed for successful adaptation. </p><h3> Stages of Adjustment </h3><p> Individuals adapt through overlapping, non-linear stages: </p><h4> Shock and Denial (Immediate-First Days) </h4><div class="spec-box"><strong> Characteristics: </strong><ul><li> Emotional numbness </li><li> Difficulty comprehending reality </li><li> Denial ("This isn't happening"; "I'll walk again") </li><li> Detachment from situation </li></ul><br><strong> Support: </strong> Calm, factual information; presence; avoid over-reassurance that seems false. </div><h4> Grief and Despair (First Weeks-Months) </h4><div class="spec-box"><strong> Characteristics: </strong><ul><li> Profound sadness over lost abilities </li><li> Anger (at circumstances, at medical team, at God/fate) </li><li> Bargaining ("If I'm good...", "If only...") </li><li> Suicidal ideation (15-20% of amputees experience this; vigilance required) </li><li> Withdrawal from family and activities </li></ul><br><strong> Support: </strong> Validation of feelings; suicide risk assessment; antidepressant medication if needed; peer support; professional mental health intervention. </div><h4> Anger and Frustration </h4><div class="spec-box"><strong> Characteristics: </strong><ul><li> Explosive reactions to small problems </li><li> Blame externally (doctors, fate, others) </li><li> Resistance to rehabilitation </li><li> Testing relationships (will family still love me?) </li></ul><br><strong> Support: </strong> Acknowledge anger as normal; set boundaries on destructive behavior; avoid taking anger personally; redirect energy to rehabilitation. </div><h4> Adaptation and Acceptance (Weeks to Months-Years) </h4><div class="spec-box"><strong> Characteristics: </strong><ul><li> Realistic understanding of loss and abilities </li><li> Engagement in rehabilitation </li><li> Setting new, achievable goals </li><li> Reconnection with others </li><li> Gradual restoration of identity ("I'm not my disability") </li></ul><br><strong> Support: </strong> Continued rehabilitation; recognition of progress; facilitation of return to meaningful activities; support for identity reconstruction. </div><h3> Preventing Psychological Despair </h3><ul><li><strong> Early intervention: </strong> Psychological support should begin immediately, not wait until depression develops. </li><li><strong> Goal setting: </strong> Concrete, achievable short-term goals (walk 10 feet, dress self, return to work) provide hope and direction. </li><li><strong> Visible progress: </strong> Regular measurement and acknowledgment of functional improvements has profound psychological benefit. </li><li><strong> Return to purpose: </strong> Identifying meaningful activities—work, family roles, hobbies—and working toward re-engagement is central. </li><li><strong> Social connection: </strong> Isolation amplifies despair. Family involvement, peer support groups, and community re-engagement are protective. </li></ul><h3> Peer Support and Role Models </h3><p> Meeting others who have adapted successfully is transformative. A person who was recently amputated sees in a successful prosthetic user proof that life continues and can be full. </p><div class="success"><strong> Evidence-based benefits of peer support: </strong><ul><li> Reduces depression and anxiety </li><li> Improves prosthetic acceptance and use </li><li> Increases adherence to rehabilitation </li><li> Provides practical advice ("Here's how I shower with a prosthetic") </li><li> Normalizes adaptation process </li></ul></div><h3> Return to Purpose: Vocational and Recreational Rehabilitation </h3><p> For many people, work is central to identity. Successful vocational rehabilitation—whether in original job, modified job, or new career—is closely tied to psychological recovery. </p><h4> Vocational Assessment </h4><ul><li> Realistic evaluation of current capabilities vs. job demands </li><li> Identification of essential job functions (can they be modified?) </li><li> Work-hardening program (graduated return to work) </li><li> Job modification or accommodation (adaptive equipment, schedule changes, assistive technology) </li><li> Retraining if original job not feasible </li></ul><h4> Recreation and Leisure </h4><p> Return to hobbies and leisure activities is often overlooked but critical for quality of life. Many activities once thought impossible can be adapted or performed differently. </p><ul><li><strong> Sports: </strong> Wheelchair athletics, adaptive skiing, swimming, archery, wheelchair basketball </li><li><strong> Crafts: </strong> Woodworking, painting, writing (often with adapted tools) </li><li><strong> Social: </strong> Restaurant dining, travel, socializing (requires adaptive strategies but very possible) </li><li><strong> Family roles: </strong> Playing with children, cooking, gardening </li></ul><h3> Sexual Function and Body Image </h3><p> Disability profoundly affects sexual identity and function. Often overlooked by medical teams, but essential for life satisfaction. </p><div class="spec-box"><strong> Common concerns: </strong><ul><li> Body image changes; shame or disgust with residual limb </li><li> Fear of rejection by partner </li><li> Erectile dysfunction (from neurological injury, medications, or psychological factors) </li><li> Difficulty with positioning during intercourse </li><li> Concerns about prosthetic displacement during intimacy </li></ul><br><strong> Support: </strong> Psychosexual counseling; communication with partner; exploration of adaptive positions/strategies; treatment of sexual dysfunction; validation that disability does not eliminate sexuality. </div><h3> Long-Term Adjustment and Thriving </h3><p> Most individuals do achieve meaningful adaptation, though the timeline varies. Some report post-traumatic growth—positive changes in relationships, values, or personal strength following the trauma. Others describe continued struggle alongside functional adaptation. </p><div class="success"><strong> Markers of successful psychological adaptation: </strong><ul><li> Realistic self-assessment (acknowledges limitations and capabilities) </li><li> Engagement in rehabilitation and use of adaptive equipment </li><li> Return to meaningful roles and activities (work, family, community) </li><li> Active social relationships </li><li> Management of grief without depression </li><li> Hope and sense of purpose </li><li> Acceptance of self with disability, not despite it </li></ul></div></section><section class="related-guides"><h3> Related Guides </h3><p> For more detailed information on related topics, consult these companion guides: </p><div><a class="guide-link" href="surgery-field.html"> Surgery & Field Medicine </a><a class="guide-link" href="medical-reference.html"> Medical Reference </a><a class="guide-link" href="woodcarving-furniture.html"> Woodcarving & Furniture </a><a class="guide-link" href="leather-tanning.html"> Leather Tanning & Working </a><a class="guide-link" href="metalworking.html"> Metalworking </a><a class="guide-link" href="optics-vision.html"> Optics & Vision </a><a class="guide-link" href="dentistry-midwifery.html"> Dentistry & Midwifery </a></div></section><div class="common-mistakes"><h3> Common Mistakes </h3><ul><li> Add specific common mistakes here based on the guide content </li></ul></div><div class="notes-section"><div class="notes-header"><span> My Notes </span><span class="notes-toggle"> ▼ </span></div><div class="notes-content"><textarea class="notes-textarea" id="guide-notes-text" placeholder='Add your personal notes here.
