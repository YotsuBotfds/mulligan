Air forces fuel into bright orange burning zone. Good airflow control enables any temperature from black heat (cooling) to white heat (burning). Three essential components: (1) Fire pot (holds fuel and work), (2) Tuyere (air delivery), (3) Bellows (air pressure source).</p><h3>Solid Fuel vs Liquid Fuel</h3><p><strong>Coal:</strong> Bituminous coal ideal; anthracite hard to light. Coal temperature ~2200°C at optimum. Readily available, cheap ($500/ton bulk). Smokes (air pollution, legal restrictions in some areas). Coke (coal heated without oxygen, removes volatile compounds) burns hotter, less smoke, more expensive ($1500/ton).</p><p><strong>Charcoal:</strong> Hardwood charcoal produces 2000°C (lower than coal but adequate). No smoke, burns clean. Cost $20-40 per 20 lb bag (expensive for continuous use). Better for small hobby smiths, poorer economics for production shops.</p></section><section id="forge-materials"><h2>Forge Materials & Dimensions</h2><h3>Fire Pot Specifications</h3><p>Diameter: 12-18 inches (30-45 cm). Depth: 8-12 inches (20-30 cm). Material: cast iron (highest thermal mass, lasts longest) or firebrick. Bottom should be saucer-shaped (coal piles toward center, work at sides). Sides: angled outward (coal doesn't jam against sides). Tuyere opening: 2-4 inches diameter, positioned 2-3 inches below grate level, angled to direct air up through coal.</p><h3>Forge Housing Dimensions</h3><p>Typical tabletop forge: 36" width × 30" depth × 36" height (work surface at comfortable height, 36" typical). Table must support 200+ lbs (heavy cast iron, hot metal). Surrounding space: 10 feet minimum clear space (for hammer swings, safe movement). Roof clearance: 12 feet minimum (smoke and heat rise). Material: steel plate (1/4") for table legs and frame, cast iron or firebrick interior surfaces.</p><h3>Grate Construction</h3><p>Below fire pot: metal grate or bars spaced 1 inch apart (coal doesn't fall through, ash drops). Grate material: cast iron or steel (1-inch bar, 2 inches apart). Grate supported on adjustable bearings (rotate to clean ash, replace when burned through). Ash pit below grate collects debris (cleaned weekly for hobby forge, daily for production).</p></section><section id="airflow"><h2>Airflow & Bellows Design</h2><h3>Air Pressure Requirements</h3><p>Minimum pressure: 0.5 PSI (3.5 cm water column) sustains basic fire. Optimal: 2-4 PSI (14-28 cm water column) creates bright hot coal without excess fuel consumption. Excessive pressure (>6 PSI) blows coal around, wastes fuel, creates difficulty controlling temperature zone.</p><h3>Bellows Types</h3><p><strong>Lever (single-acting):</strong> Handle pushed down, forces air through one-way valve into forge. Simple, inexpensive ($300-500). Requires hand pumping (exhausting for continuous work).</p><p><strong>Box bellows (double-acting):</strong> Two chambers, one filling while other expels. More continuous air flow. Cost $600-1000. Still requires hand operation.</p><p><strong>Electric blower:</strong> Fan (1/2-1 HP electric motor) draws air through filter, supplies forge continuously. Most convenient (no hand pumping). Cost $400-800 including motor, fan, and ducting. Requires electricity.</p><h3>Air Line Design</h3><p>Diameter: 3-4 inches minimum (larger = less resistance). Length: direct connection best, but practical installations may have 10-20 foot runs. Every 10 feet of 3-inch duct adds ~0.5 PSI pressure drop. Insulation: hot air from forge may heat bellows/blower (damages seals). Insulate lines or add water-cooling jacket.</p></section><section id="temperature-colors"><h2>Temperature Color Chart & SVG</h2><svg viewbox='0 0 600 450' xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="background:#1a2e1a" aria-label='Blacksmithing diagram 1'><defs><lineargradient id="tempGrad1" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%"><stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#1a1a1a;stop-opacity:1"></stop><stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#1a1a1a;stop-opacity:1"></stop></lineargradient><lineargradient id="tempGrad2" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%"><stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#4a2020;stop-opacity:1"></stop><stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#4a2020;stop-opacity:1"></stop></lineargradient><lineargradient id="tempGrad3" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%"><stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#663333;stop-opacity:1"></stop><stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#663333;stop-opacity:1"></stop></lineargradient><lineargradient id="tempGrad4" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%"><stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#993333;stop-opacity:1"></stop><stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#993333;stop-opacity:1"></stop></lineargradient><lineargradient id="tempGrad5" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%"><stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#cc3333;stop-opacity:1"></stop><stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#cc3333;stop-opacity:1"></stop></lineargradient><lineargradient id="tempGrad6" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%"><stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#ff4444;stop-opacity:1"></stop><stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ff4444;stop-opacity:1"></stop></lineargradient><lineargradient id="tempGrad7" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%"><stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#ff6600;stop-opacity:1"></stop><stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ff6600;stop-opacity:1"></stop></lineargradient><lineargradient id="tempGrad8" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%"><stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#ffbb00;stop-opacity:1"></stop><stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffbb00;stop-opacity:1"></stop></lineargradient><lineargradient id="tempGrad9" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%"><stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#ffff00;stop-opacity:1"></stop><stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffff00;stop-opacity:1"></stop></lineargradient><lineargradient id="tempGrad10" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="0%"><stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"></stop><stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#ffffff;stop-opacity:1"></stop></lineargradient></defs><text x="20" y="30" font-size="18" fill="#d4a574" font-weight="bold">Steel Forging Temperature Color Guide</text><rect x="50" y="60" width="50" height="30" fill="url(#tempGrad1)" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2"></rect><text x="110" y="75" font-size="12" fill="#d4a574">Black Heat</text><text x="110" y="90" font-size="11" fill="#b8956a"><400°C -

Burning (waste heat)</text></svg></section><section id="heat-sources"><h2>Coal vs Charcoal Comparison</h2><h3>Coal Characteristics</h3><p>Bituminous coal: carbon (50-60%), hydrogen (3-5%), oxygen (2-5%), sulfur (0.5-4%), ash (15-25%). Volatile compounds release during heating create smoke and odor. Coking (heating to 1000°C without oxygen) removes volatiles → coke burns hotter, less smoke. Cost: raw coal $500/ton (bulk), $15-20 per 50 lb bag retail. Heat value: 26 MJ/kg (high energy).</p><h3>Charcoal Characteristics</h3><p>Hardwood charcoal: 85-90% carbon, rest oxygen, hydrogen, ash. Created by heating wood without oxygen (traditional charcoal kiln or modern retort). Cleaner burning than coal (no sulfur, smoke reduced). Cost: $20-40 per 20 lb bag ($1000-2000/ton equivalent). Heat value: 30 MJ/kg (slightly higher than coal). Disadvantage: expensive for production use.</p><h3>Economics & Practical Choice</h3><p>Hobby smith (occasional use): charcoal better (cleaner, less air pollution, acceptable cost for part-time use). Production shop (daily use): coal essential (economics). Large shops develop dual systems: charcoal for fine work (tool hardening, detailed forging), coal for heavy work (bulk forging, reheating).</p></section><section id="forging-techniques"><h2>Step-by-Step Forging Techniques</h2><h3>Drawing Out (Lengthening)</h3><p>(1) Heat metal to bright orange (900°C). (2) Place on anvil face. (3) Strike perpendicular with cross-peen hammer, moving hammer slightly forward with each strike (overlapping blows). (4) After 3-4 strikes, rotate work 90°, repeat in perpendicular direction. (5) Return to first direction, continue until desired length achieved. Result: metal longer, narrower, thinner. Repeat heating/forging cycles every 10-15 seconds (never work cold metal).</p><h3>Upsetting (Thickening)</h3><p>(1) Heat end of metal to bright orange. (2) Stand work vertically on anvil (end up). (3) Strike top of work with hammer, driving downward. (4) After each strike, rotate slightly to build even thickness. (5) Continue until diameter increased sufficiently. Used for: creating heads (hammer, axe), building up sections for subsequent drawing.</p><h3>Bending</h3><p>(1) Heat entire region to bright orange. (2) Place bend point on anvil horn (for gentle curves) or edge (for sharp bends). (3) Strike sides with hammer, gradually increasing bend angle. (4) Rotate and strike opposite side, distributing bending evenly. Result: smooth curve without sharp kink (sharp bends = stress concentration, failure point).</p><h3>Twisting</h3><p>(1) Heat entire work to bright orange. (2) Clamp one end in vise. (3) Grip other end with wrench or special tongs. (4) Rotate slowly, even pressure (fast twisting = metal breaks). (5) Continue until desired twist angle achieved (typically 90-180 degrees). Watch for color change (stop if cooling to dark orange—reheat).</p><h3>Punching & Drifting (Making Holes)</h3><p>(1) Heat work to bright orange. (2) Position on bolster plate (separate small steel block under hole location). (3) Strike punch with hammer, driving through hot metal. (4) Flip work, support from opposite side, complete hole from other direction (prevents burr at exit). (5) Enlarge hole with progressively larger drifts (tapered mandrels), using same heating/striking technique.</p><h4>Forge Welding (Advanced)</h4><p>(1) Heat both pieces to bright yellow (1100-1150°C), coated with flux (borax). (2) Pieces must be extremely clean: no paint, oil, oxidized surface (wire brush immediately before forge). (3) Bring pieces together on anvil at correct angle (usually face-to-face or side-by-side). (4) Strike with hammer using rapid blows, squeezing pieces together. (5) If successful, pieces bond permanently as single metal mass. If unsuccessful, pieces separate (poor weld, brittle).</p></section><section id="hand-positions"><h2>Hand Positions & Safety</h2><h3>Hammer Grip</h3><p>Grip hammer near end of handle (not choked up at head). Swing from elbow, not wrist. Hammer should weigh 2-4 lbs for comfort (lighter = faster swing, heavier = more force). Strike work, never anvil (bouncing off anvil causes inaccuracy and hammer damage). Wear heavy leather apron and gloves (spark/heat protection).</p><h3>Tongs Positioning</h3><p>Hold tongs with thumb/fingers controlling jaw opening. Never cross fingers (tongs can slip, catching hand). Maintain firm grip: loose tongs = work flies off. Watch work at all times (sudden movement possible). Keep arms flexed (ready to move quickly if work falls or tongs slip).</p><h3>Eye Protection</h3><p>Wear face shield or safety glasses (spark hazard). Gray glass lens (not dark, not light) for optimal visibility. Sparks traveling 50+ feet at high velocity (eye injury risk). Check equipment daily for damage (cracked lens = replace immediately).</p><h3>Foot Protection</h3><p>Steel-toed boots mandatory (dropped metal burns through ordinary shoes, can cause severe foot burns). Heavy leather protects from sparks better than canvas. No open-toed shoes or sandals near forge (dangerous).</p></section><section id="tool-manufacturing"><h2>Tool Manufacturing</h2><h3>Hammer Head Forging</h3><p>(1) Start with short piece of square steel (2×2×3 inches, 1045 steel). (2) Heat to bright orange. (3) Flatten one end on anvil (will be striking face, needs 2-inch diameter). (4) Heat and upset other end (will be striking end, create slight bulge). (5) Heat whole piece, carefully forge eye hole (approx 1.5 inches diameter). (6) Harden: quench in water while glowing bright red. (7) Temper: reheat to straw color (325°C approximate), quench again. Result: hardened striking face, flexible body.</p><h3>Chisel Forging</h3><p>(1) Start with 1-inch square × 8-inch long 1095 high-carbon steel. (2) Heat one end (chisel cutting end). (3) Flatten and thin cutting end (sharp edge). (4) Keep handle end thicker (prevent mushrooming from hammer strikes). (5) Harden: quench glowing bright red in water. (6) Temper: reheat to blue color (550°C approximate, allows slight flexibility in handle). (7) Grind or file edge to sharp finish.</p><h3>Tool Steel Selection</h3><p><strong>1045 medium-carbon steel:</strong> General-purpose, reasonable hardness, relatively easy to work. Suitable for hammers, punches.</p><p><strong>1095 high-carbon steel:</strong> Very hard when heat-treated, brittle (prone to cracking). Suitable for chisels, tools cutting other metals.</p><p><strong>1018 mild steel:</strong> Soft, easy to forge, cannot be hardened effectively. Suitable for decorative work, nails.</p></section><section id="heat-treatment"><h2>Heat Treatment Procedures</h2><h3>Hardening Process</h3><p>(1) Heat steel to critical temperature (dull red for low-carbon, bright red for high-carbon). (2) Quench immediately in water (fastest cooling), oil (slower, less cracking), or brine (fast, high hardness). (3) Cool completely. (4) Steel is now hard but brittle.</p><h3>Tempering for Toughness</h3><p>(1) After hardening, steel is too brittle. (2) Reheat to lower temperature (specific color indicates temperature). (3) Quench again (stop oxidation process). (4) Temper color directly indicates hardness/toughness: light straw = hardest (cutting tools), dark blue = toughest (springs, handles).</p><h3>Tempering Temperature Guide</h3><p>Straw color (325°C): hardest, used for chisels, saw blades (cutting edges). Brown (375°C): medium hardness, used for punches, dies. Purple (425°C): medium-hard, used for springs. Dark blue (550°C): soft, used for handles, springs. Gray (600°C+): very soft (annealing, basically non-hardened).</p><h3>Annealing (Softening)</h3><p>(1) Heat steel to bright cherry red (700°C). (2) Cool very slowly (bury in sand, wrap in newspaper, leave overnight). (3) Result: soft steel, easy to machine/forge. Used when work-hardening makes metal brittle or machinery modification required.</p></section><section id="hardening-tempering"><h2>Hardening & Tempering with Timing</h2><h3>Time at Temperature</h3><p>Critical temperature reached when metal stops glowing red and transitions to dark red (approximately 30-60 seconds at bright red for small pieces). Hold at temperature 10-15 seconds, no longer (longer = grain growth, makes steel brittle). Duration depends on size: 1-inch stock 20-30 seconds, 2-inch stock 30-40 seconds.</p><h3>Quench Timing</h3><p>Quench immediately after reaching critical temperature (cooling rate critical: slower cooling = less hardness, faster = more hardness but more cracking risk). Water cooling fastest (1000°C drop in 2 seconds typical), oil slower (prevents cracking but less hardness), brine fastest but extreme cracking risk. Balance: oil quench for most tools, water for maximum hardness where cracking acceptable (can be filed/dressed out).</p><h3>Tempering Timing & Color Development</h3><p>After quenching and cooling completely, wipe with cloth to reveal true surface color (scale oxidation creates color). As metal reheats, color changes predictably: (1-2 min at 325°C) = light straw, (2-3 min at 375°C) = brown, (3-4 min at 425°C) = purple, (4-5 min at 550°C) = dark blue. Watch color carefully (develops suddenly over 10-20 seconds near target temperature). Quench immediately when desired color achieved (stop oxidation process).</p></section><section id="anvil-anatomy"><h2>Anvil Anatomy with SVG</h2><svg viewbox='0 0 600 400' xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="background:#2d2416" aria-label='Blacksmithing diagram 2'><defs><lineargradient id="anvGrad" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="100%"><stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#888;stop-opacity:1"></stop><stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#333;stop-opacity:1"></stop></lineargradient></defs><text x="20" y="30" font-size="16" fill="#d4a574" font-weight="bold">Anvil Anatomy & Key Features</text><ellipse cx="300" cy="220" rx="150" ry="60" fill="url(#anvGrad)" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2"></ellipse><rect x="180" y="220" width="240" height="100" fill="#6b5344" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2"></rect><ellipse cx="300" cy="220" rx="150" ry="30" fill="#888" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2"></ellipse><rect x="200" y="200" width="30" height="35" fill="#555" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2"></rect><text x="205" y="225" font-size="11" fill="#f5f0e8" font-weight="bold">Hardy<br></br>Hole</text><circle cx="400" cy="190" r="12" fill="#555" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2"></circle><text x="420" y="195" font-size="12" fill="#d4a574">Pritchel Hole</text><path d='M 100 200 L 120 210 L 120 230 Z' fill="#666" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2"></path><text x="90" y="250" font-size="11" fill="#d4a574">Horn</text><path d='M 480 200 L 500 210 L 500 230 Z' fill="#666" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2"></path><text x="480" y="250" font-size="11" fill="#d4a574">Heel</text><text x="250" y="160" font-size="12" fill="#d4a574" font-weight="bold">Striking Face (flat)</text><text x="20" y="340" font-size="12" fill="#d4a574" font-weight="bold">Key Features:</text><text x="20" y="360" font-size="11" fill="#b8956a">Hardy Hole: square opening accepts wedge-shaped tools</text><text x="20" y="375" font-size="11" fill="#b8956a">Pritchel Hole: round hole for drifts and punches</text><text x="320" y="360" font-size="11" fill="#b8956a">Horn: cone shape for bending, rounding</text><text x="320" y="375" font-size="11" fill="#b8956a">Face: hardened steel, must be flat for good work</text></svg></section><section id="forge-welds"><h2>Forge Welding Techniques</h2><h3>Joint Preparation</h3><p>Pieces to be welded must be: (1) Clean (no rust, paint, scale). Wire brush immediately before heating. (2) Same metal composition (steel to steel, iron to iron, avoid mixing). (3) Proper thickness matching (unequal thickness creates weak spot at thin section). (4) Flux applied (borax typical, reduces oxidation). (5) Both pieces reaching yellow heat (bright yellow, sparking slightly).</p><h3>Striking Technique for Welds</h3><p>Bring pieces together at correct angle. Strike hammer blows rapidly and firmly: (1) Initial blows light (compress pieces together, no damage). (2) Progressive blows harder (force flux out, compress joint). (3) Final hard blow locks pieces together. Pattern: center strikes, then strikes along length of joint. Entire process <5 seconds (if joint too cool, reheat and retry; never repeatedly strike cold joint = fracture).</p><h3>Common Weld Failures</h3><p><strong>Cold shut:</strong> Joint appears joined but lacks fusion (separate under stress). Cause: temperature too low, pieces not fully heated. Prevention: ensure bright yellow heat on both pieces before striking.</p><p><strong>Lap weld:</strong> One piece overlaps without fusing. Cause: uneven heating, pieces misaligned. Prevention: precise heating and alignment before striking.</p><p><strong>Brittle weld:</strong> Looks good but cracks under load. Cause: grain growth from excessive temperature or grain-boundary oxidation. Prevention: don't exceed bright yellow heat, clean pieces thoroughly.</p></section><section id="common-mistakes"><h2>Common Beginner Mistakes</h2><ul><li><strong>Working cold metal:</strong> Metal must glow to be workable.

Damaged lens = replace immediately.</li></ul></section><div class="warning"><strong>Safety Warning:</strong> Blacksmithing involves extreme heat (white metal 1200°C), flying sparks, and heavy hammer work. Burns are common: never touch hot metal without long-handle tongs. Sparks travel far (50+ feet); wear heavy leather apron, gloves, closed-toe boots. Eye protection mandatory; flying scale and sparks cause permanent blindness. Quench water can boil explosively if contaminated; keep clean water and monitor closely. Smoke inhalation from coal forge causes health effects; ensure proper ventilation with hood exhaust.</strong></div><div class="tip"><strong>Learning Tip:</strong> Blacksmithing skill develops through experience. Start with simple projects (nails, hooks, simple bends). Watch videos, learn from experienced smiths. Join local blacksmithing club (shared equipment, instruction, community). Modern hammer striking is physics-based: let hammer weight do work, don't muscle excessive force. Proper technique = less fatigue, better results.</tip><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="internal-combustion.html">Internal Combustion Engines</a><a href="metalworking.html">Metalworking</a><a href="hydroelectric.html">Hydroelectric Systems</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
