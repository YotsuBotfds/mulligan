Frequency f and wavelength λ related: c = f × λ where c = 299,792,458 m/s (speed of light). Examples: 1 MHz radio → 300m wavelength. 100 MHz FM → 3m wavelength. 2.4 GHz WiFi → 12.5 cm wavelength. Higher frequency = shorter wavelength = smaller antenna = higher bandwidth.</p><h3>Amplitude Modulation (AM)</h3><p>Amplitude of carrier wave varied at audio frequency. Audio signal modulates carrier amplitude: A(t) = A₀[1 + m sin(ωₐt)] sin(ωc t) where m is modulation index (0-1), ωₐ is audio frequency, ωc is carrier. Bandwidth = 2 × audio frequency (single sideband 1 × audio). AM 540-1700 kHz band: each station occupies 10 kHz (maximum audio frequency 5 kHz). Susceptible to noise and interference (amplitude fluctuations carry noise).</p><h3>Frequency Modulation (FM)</h3><p>Frequency of carrier varied at audio frequency. Audio modulates frequency: f(t) = fc + Δf sin(ωₐ t) where Δf is frequency deviation (±75 kHz typical for FM broadcast). Bandwidth = 2(Δf + fₐ) = 2(75 + 5) = 160 kHz per station. FM 88-108 MHz band: 100 stations possible. Better noise immunity (frequency variations don't affect amplitude, noise usually amplitude modulation). Wider bandwidth = fewer stations per band but higher audio quality.</p></section><section id=frequency-bands><h2>Frequency Bands & Regulations</h2><h3>Amateur Radio Allocations</h3><p><strong>HF (3-30 MHz):</strong> 160m, 80m, 40m, 20m, 15m, 10m bands. Long-distance communication via ionosphere reflection (skip). Prone to interference, atmospheric noise (especially 160m/80m).</p><p><strong>VHF (30-300 MHz):</strong> 2m, 70cm bands (144-148 MHz, 420-450 MHz). Line-of-sight propagation 10-100 km range typical. Local communication, repeaters.</p><p><strong>UHF (300-3000 MHz):</strong> 23cm, 13cm bands and higher. Very short-range line-of-sight, high bandwidth. Propagation losses significant (path loss = 20 log₁₀(f×d) where f is frequency MHz, d is distance miles).</p><h3>Transmitter Power Limits</h3><p>FCC Amateur Radio: 1500W PEP (peak envelope power) on HF, 1200W on VHF/UHF, less on higher frequencies. Higher power = greater range but more interference potential. Low-power operation (QRP) 5-10W common for emergency communication and portable operation (lower power consumption, smaller battery, lighter equipment).</p><h3>Licensing & Regulations</h3><p>Amateur radio license required in most countries. US FCC Technician class license allows VHF/UHF transmission after written exam. General class adds HF privileges. Requirements: equipment must not radiate outside licensed frequency band (within ±5 ppm accuracy typical). Call sign required, transmitted periodically (every 10 minutes minimum). Fines: $250,000 maximum for violating frequency restrictions or operating without license.</p></section><section id=antenna-design><h2>Antenna Design & Types</h2><h3>Dipole Antenna</h3><p>Simplest antenna: two quarter-wavelength conductors extending opposite directions from feedpoint. Total length ≈ λ/2 (slight shortening factor 0.96 typical). Example: 40m band (7 MHz) dipole = 0.96 × 40/2 = 19.2 meters long. Resonant at design frequency (lowest impedance ~70Ω at feedpoint, easily matched). Radiation pattern: maximum radiation broadside (perpendicular to antenna), minimum (nulls) at ends.</p><h3>Monopole Antenna</h3><p>Quarter-wavelength conductor mounted vertical, ground plane below. Radiation pattern: omnidirectional (horizontal). Length = λ/4. Example: 2m VHF band monopole = 0.96 × 2/4 = 0.48 meters (19 inches). Ground plane improves radiation (should be 1-2 wavelengths minimum area). Used in mobile/fixed installations where low profile desired.</p><h3>Yagi Antenna</h3><p>Directional antenna: driven element (dipole) plus parasitic elements (reflector 5% longer, directors 5% shorter). Gains 7-10 dB (5-10× power increase). Narrow beamwidth 30-50 degrees. Popular for directional communication and long-distance links. Three-element Yagi 3-4 feet long on 2m band (frequency determines size).</p><h3>Parabolic Dish</h3><p>High-gain antenna: small dipole or horn at focus of large reflector. Gain increases with dish size and frequency (proportional to (2πd/λ)² where d is dish diameter). 1-meter dish at 2.4 GHz = 34 dB gain = 2500× power multiplication. Used in microwave links and satellite communications. Very narrow beamwidth requires careful aiming.</p></section><section id=transmitters><h2>Transmitter Basics</h2><h3>Oscillator</h3><p>Generates carrier frequency signal. Crystal oscillator most stable: piezoelectric quartz crystal resonates at design frequency (typically 0.001% accuracy). Common frequencies: 1-50 MHz range. Higher frequencies less stable (frequency changes with temperature). Temperature compensation (TXCO): oscillator frequency varies with temperature, automatic correction maintains ±0.5 ppm accuracy.</p><h3>Modulation Stage</h3><p>Modulator mixes audio signal with carrier. Amplitude modulation: audio controls amplifier bias/gain. Frequency modulation: audio-controlled oscillator frequency varies carrier. Phase modulation: audio varies oscillator phase. Resulting signal: carrier frequency ± (modulation frequency × deviation factor). Output typically 10-100 mW, must be amplified.</p><h3>Power Amplifier</h3><p>Amplifier increases modulated signal to desired transmit power. Class A amplifier: linear (output proportional to input), good for SSB modulation. Efficiency ~50%. Class C amplifier: highly efficient (80-90%) but non-linear (unsuitable for SSB). Good for FM/ASK modulation. Requires efficient heat sinking to dissipate wasted power: 100W transmitter, 90% efficiency = 10W waste heat (must dissipate via heatsink).</p><h3>Output Stage</h3><p>Final amplifier stage feeds antenna. Low-impedance output 50Ω typically (matches transmission line and antenna). Impedance matching transformer or tuner ensures maximum power transfer (minimum reflection). Reflected power from antenna mismatch causes heat in transmission line and efficiency loss. SWR (standing wave ratio) <1.5:1 acceptable, <1.2:1 excellent.</p></section><section id=receivers><h2>Receiver Design</h2><h3>Tuned RF Amplifier</h3><p>Receives weak antenna signal (µV range typical). RF amplifier with tuned input filters desired frequency, rejects out-of-band interference. Gain 10-20 dB (10-100×). Noise figure 2-5 dB (determines receiver sensitivity). Low-noise amplifier (LNA) essential for weak-signal reception: noise figure <1 dB achievable with careful design.</p><h3>Superheterodyne Receiver</h3><p>Received signal mixed (frequency conversion) with local oscillator. Intermediate frequency (IF) = Receive frequency - Local oscillator frequency (or + for upper sideband). Example: 146 MHz signal mixed with 145 MHz local oscillator = 1 MHz IF. All received stations converted to same IF, then amplified and filtered (IF filter). Then demodulated to recover modulation (audio).</p><h3>Demodulation</h3><p><strong>AM demodulation:</strong> Diode detector or synchronous detector. Simple diode: rectifies AM signal, capacitor filter removes RF ripple, leaving audio. Synchronous: multiplies received signal by recovered carrier frequency, more selective (better rejection of adjacent stations).</p><p><strong>FM demodulation:</strong> Frequency discriminator or phase-locked loop (PLL). Discriminator: frequencysensitive filter converts frequency deviation to amplitude, demodulates like AM. PLL: locks oscillator to incoming frequency, control voltage output is demodulated audio. PLL more robust to interference.</p><h3>Automatic Gain Control (AGC)</h3><p>Receiver gain varies with signal strength (strong signals overload, weak signals inaudible). AGC circuit adjusts gain automatically: strong signal → reduce gain, weak signal → increase gain. Maintains relatively constant audio output regardless of received signal strength. Attack time (fast gain reduction) 100 ms, decay time (slow gain recovery) 1-2 seconds. AGC prevents receiver saturation and improves dynamic range.</p></section><section id=morse-code><h2>Morse Code & CW</h2><h3>Morse Code Basics</h3><p>Dots (dit) and dashes (dah) represent letters/numbers. Timing: dot duration = 1 unit, dash = 3 units, space between elements = 1 unit, space between letters = 3 units, space between words = 7 units. Speed measured in words-per-minute (WPM): PARIS standard word (50 dots) at 1 WPM = 1.2 seconds per word. Typical speeds: 5-25 WPM novice, 25-40 WPM experienced operator.</p><h3>CW Transmission</h3><p>Continuous wave: carrier frequency modulated on/off at Morse code rate. No amplitude or frequency modulation, just on/off keying. Requires: oscillator, keyer (electronic circuit switching carrier on/off), power amplifier. Very simple transmitter (can be hand-built in hours). Requires training to send/receive (motor skill, hearing interpretation).</p><h3>CW Reception</h3><p>Received CW signal very weak (µV typically). RF amplifier must achieve high gain (20-30 dB minimum) to pull signal out of noise. Tuned receiver (narrow filter, <100 Hz bandwidth) rejects interference outside frequency. Audio oscillator (beat frequency oscillator, BFO) shifted 700 Hz from receiver frequency produces audio tone audible to operator. Operator listens to audio tone pattern, decodes Morse code.</p><h3>Advantages of CW</h3><p>Narrow bandwidth (100-300 Hz vs 2.7 kHz for SSB voice = 27× less spectral space). CW signal 3dB stronger than voice for same transmit power (because CW is continuous during transmission, voice has 50% average power due to speech pauses). Result: CW effective range 5-10× greater than voice at same power. CW immunity to interference superior: pulse noise causes minimal disruption to Morse code reception (operator can tolerate 30% noise corruption).</p></section><section id=signal-propagation><h2>Signal Propagation Modes</h2><h3>Ground Wave</h3><p>Signal follows Earth's curvature, diffraction around terrain. Most effective at low frequencies (LF, MF, HF). Range depends on frequency and power: 1 MHz at 1 kW ground wave reaches ~100 km. 100 MHz (VHF) ground wave ~10 km only. Ground conductivity significant: seawater excellent (extends range), sand poor (reduces range). Used for maritime communication and long-distance broadcasting at HF/MF.</p><h3>Ionospheric Reflection (Skip)</h3><p>Radio waves at HF frequencies (3-30 MHz) refracted by ionosphere (charged particle layers 80-400 km altitude). Rays bounce off ionosphere, returning to Earth, reflecting off ground, bouncing back to ionosphere, repeated globally. Range: 500-3000 km per hop (one bounce). Multiple hops enable worldwide communication at low power.</p><h3>Ionosphere Variability</h3><p>Ionosphere strength varies: daily (weakest at night), seasonally (weakest in summer), and with 11-year solar cycle. Solar flares increase ionospheric density (extends range, improves propagation). Sunspots increase frequency of flares. Current solar cycle (2024): cycle 25, approaching peak (high sunspot activity). Best HF conditions last 1-2 years around solar maximum.</p><h3>Tropospheric Propagation</h3><p>VHF/UHF signals refracted by troposphere (weather layer, 0-15 km altitude). Under normal conditions: line-of-sight only (horizon limit). Temperature inversion (warm layer above cold layer) causes ducting: signals guided around Earth's curvature, extending range 300-500 km. Occurs after sunset during stable atmospheric conditions. Rare but dramatic improvement enables long-distance 2m band contacts.</p></section><section id=repeaters><h2>Repeater Stations</h2><h3>Repeater Function</h3><p>Fixed station receiving weak VHF/UHF signal from mobile, retransmitting amplified signal on different frequency. Extends communication range: mobile-to-mobile direct range 10-50 km, mobile-to-repeater 50 km, repeater-to-mobile 50 km = total 100 km. Repeater typically located on high hill (maximizes line-of-sight coverage). Operates 24/7, shared community resource.</p><h3>Duplex Operation</h3><p>Repeater transmits and receives simultaneously on different frequencies (duplex spacing). Example: 146.52 MHz input, 146.92 MHz output (±0.6 MHz offset, standard for 2m band). Mobile transmits on input frequency, listens on output. Requires simultaneous Tx/Rx equipment, duplexer filter separating Tx/Rx lines (very high isolation >80 dB required to prevent Tx energy destroying receiver).</p><h3>Repeater Linking</h3><p>Multiple repeaters linked via UHF microwave link or internet (VOIP gateway). Transmit on one repeater, receive on distant linked repeater. Enables regional/national communication networks. Internet linking allows worldwide communication using local repeater (DeStar, Echolink systems). Reduces need for long-distance HF propagation.</p></section><section id=telephone-networks><h2>Telephone Network Basics</h2><h3>POTS Network Architecture</h3><p><strong>Subscriber line (loop):</strong> Copper pair from customer phone to local exchange. Distance limit ~5 km (signal attenuation). Carries: (1) DC current for dialing (10 pulses/second for rotary, 1200/2200 Hz DTMF tones for touch-tone). (2) AC audio (300-3400 Hz voice bandwidth). (3) Ringing signal (90V AC, 20 Hz).</p><p><strong>Local exchange (CO):</strong> Switching center connecting subscriber loops. Switching fabric (mechanical crossbar or electronic) connects two incoming lines for duration of call. Modern digital switches: analog voice converted to 64 kbps PCM (8000 samples/sec × 8 bits), multiplexed on digital trunk.</p><p><strong>Trunk lines:</strong> Interconnect exchanges. High capacity (24-672 voice channels typical). Multiplexed: multiple calls share single physical line using time-division multiplexing (TDM) or frequency-division multiplexing (FDM).</p><h3>Subscriber Loop Limitations</h3><p>Distance limit: attenuation increases with frequency and distance. Voice attenuation ~0.5 dB/km at 1 kHz. 5 km loop = 2.5 dB attenuation (acceptable). Beyond 5 km: repeaters (line drivers) amplify signal every 6 km or move to digital transmission (DSL) which handles 5+ km loops effectively (up to 8 km with low-power DSL).</p><h3>Legacy vs Modern Networks</h3><p><strong>Analog POTS:</strong> All copper pairs, continuous current loop signaling, analog voice. Reliable, simple, limited bandwidth (3.4 kHz), distance limited.</p><p><strong>Digital networks (ISDN, VoIP):</strong> Fiber trunk lines, digital switching, packet-switched voice. Higher bandwidth, longer distance, lower cost infrastructure. VoIP over internet enables free/low-cost long-distance. Requires broadband internet (unreliable in remote areas, emergency call routing delayed).</p></section><div class=warning><strong>Safety Warning:</strong> High-power transmitters radiate RF energy hazardous to human tissue. FCC occupational exposure limits: 5 mW/cm² for frequencies 30 MHz-300 GHz. A 1000W transmitter 1 meter away: 1000W/(4π×1²) = 79.6 W/m² = 7.96 mW/cm² (exceeds limit). Do not stand in front of antenna during transmit. RF burn (microwave-like heating of tissue) can cause internal injury without visible burns. Install RF warning signs and mechanical interlocks preventing transmit near populated areas.</strong></div><div class=tip><strong>Learning Tip:</strong> Amateur radio licensing requires written exam but no technical background needed. Study guides available free online (ARRL, FCC). Technician class (entry-level) covers frequency allocations, regulations, safety. Learning Morse code optional but recommended (CW communication fun and effective). Start with cheap used equipment ($100-200 for complete VHF transceiver) before investing in serious station ($5000+).</tip><div class=related role="navigation" aria-label="Related guides"><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href=electrical-wiring.html>Electrical Wiring</a><a href=power-distribution.html>Power Distribution</a><a href=transistors.html>Transistors & Semiconductors</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium &mdash; Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
