Distinct carrot smell. Young plants best.</li><li><strong>Wild parsnip:</strong> Similar to wild carrot but larger root and more intense taste. Yellow flowers. Can cause photosensitivity.</li><li><strong>Jerusalem artichoke (sunchoke):</strong> Knobbly tubers, tall plant with yellow flowers. Dig after frost—cold improves flavor.</li><li><strong>Burdock root:</strong> Deep taproot, large leaves first year, flowers second year. Dig first year—roots become woody with age.</li></ul><h3>Fall Fruits</h3><ul><li><strong>Rose hips:</strong> Red fruit after flowers fade, seeds inside. High vitamin C. Steep for tea or make syrup.</li><li><strong>Hawthorn berries:</strong> Small red berries, white flower precedes fruit. Traditional heart tonic, mild flavor.</li><li><strong>Serviceberry:</strong> Dark purple berries, edible immediately. Sweet flavor.</li><li><strong>Persimmon:</strong> Orange fruit must be fully ripe (soft) before eating—unripe causes astringency. Remove large seeds.</li></ul></section><section id="winter"><h2>Winter Foraging</h2><p>Winter offers fewer fresh foods but stored seeds, nuts, dried berries, and evergreen plants provide nutrition.</p><h3>Winter Edibles</h3><ul><li><strong>Pine needles:</strong> Young needles rich in vitamin C. Steep as tea. Avoid yew which is toxic.</li><li><strong>Evergreen berries:</strong> Rose hips remaining on plant, hawthorn berries, remaining dried elderberries.</li><li><strong>Tree bark:</strong> Inner bark of birch, pine, elm edible and nutritious. Scrape inner bark layer.</li><li><strong>Roots & tubers:</strong> Stored underground from fall harvest. Jerusalem artichokes, cattail tubers, root vegetables.</li><li><strong>Seaweeds:</strong> Most nutritious dried or fresh. Kelp, sea lettuce, dulse available year-round if near ocean.</li><li><strong>Dried goods:</strong> Preserved from earlier seasons—dried berries, mushrooms, nuts provide winter nutrition.</li></ul><h3>Winter Foraging Challenges</h3><ul><li>Most green plants dormant or dead</li><li>Successful winter foraging requires preparation in earlier seasons</li><li>Focus on foods you collected and preserved in fall</li><li>Roots remain underground but difficult to harvest when frozen</li><li>Energy expenditure must not exceed caloric gain from foraging</li></ul></section><section id="poisonous"><h2>Poisonous Lookalikes & Safety</h2><p>Several poisonous plants dangerously resemble edible species. Knowing these is essential to prevent fatal mistakes.</p><h3>Deadly Poisonous Plants - MOST CRITICAL TO IDENTIFY</h3><h4>Water Hemlock vs. Wild Carrot/Parsnip - FATAL IN TINY AMOUNTS</h4><p class="warning">LIFE-THREATENING: Water hemlock (Cicuta douglasii) is the MOST TOXIC plant in North America. Ingestion of tiny amounts causes seizures and death within hours. A piece the size of a marble can be fatal. DISTINCTIVE FEATURE: chambered/hollow root bulb with cross-sections inside (looks like honeycomb when cut lengthwise).</p><ul><li><strong>Water Hemlock identification:</strong> Smooth hairless stems with PURPLE/RED BLOTCHES (very distinctive), musty/unpleasant smell, chambered hollow roots (cut lengthwise to verify), 2-4 feet tall, grows near water</li><li><strong>KEY IDENTIFIER:</strong> Cut the root bulb lengthwise—water hemlock has distinctive chambers/partitions inside (like rooms); wild carrot/parsnip roots are solid or have central white core</li><li><strong>Smell test:</strong> Musty/bad smell is key identifier (unlike carrot/parsnip which smell pleasant)</li><li><strong>Wild Carrot (Queen Anne's Lace):</strong> Hairy stems, orange taproot (solid throughout), distinctly pleasant carrot smell, white flowers with pink central floret</li><li><strong>Wild Parsnip:</strong> Hairy hollow stems, yellow flowers, pleasant parsnip smell, smooth unmarked roots</li><li><strong>DANGER:</strong> Do NOT touch water hemlock with bare hands, as toxins absorb through skin. If exposed, wash immediately with soap and water.</li></ul><h4>Destroying Angel Mushroom (Amanita virosa, A. phalloides) - FATAL IN SMALL AMOUNTS</h4><p class="warning">LIFE-THREATENING: Destroying angels cause fatal liver and kidney failure within 6-12 hours. Cooking does NOT destroy the toxin. A single mushroom can kill an adult. No antidote exists.</p><ul><li><strong>Identifying characteristics:</strong> Pure white cap, white gills, white spore print, characteristic bulbous base (volva) at root, sweet smell, slender white stem</li><li><strong>Growth:</strong> Usually solitary near trees, especially oaks</li><li><strong>Common confusion:</strong> Edible white mushrooms (puffballs, button mushrooms) have different base structure</li><li><strong>CRITICAL CHECK:</strong> Look for volva (cup-like structure) at base—destroying angels always have this, edible white mushrooms do not</li><li><strong>NO TASTE TEST:</strong> Never taste any mushroom to test edibility—deadly mushroom toxins can be absorbed through mouth membranes</li></ul><h4>Poison Hemlock vs. Wild Carrot/Parsnip</h4><ul><li><strong>Poison Hemlock:</strong> Smooth hairless stems with red/purple blotches, musty smell, 3-4 feet tall. ALL PARTS TOXIC including skin contact.</li><li><strong>Wild Carrot:</strong> Hairy stems, orange taproot, carrot smell, white flowers with pink center.</li><li><strong>Wild Parsnip:</strong> Hairy hollow stems, yellow flowers, parsnip smell.</li><li><strong>DANGER:</strong> Poison hemlock causes severe phytophotodermatitis (burning rash when skin exposed to sun after contact). Wash immediately with soap if touched.</li></ul><h4>Foxglove vs. Comfrey - Similar Leaves, Different Toxicity</h4><ul><li><strong>Foxglove (TOXIC):</strong> Tubular bell-shaped flowers on tall spike, flowers spotted inside, alternate leaves, can be fatal if ingested</li><li><strong>Comfrey (EDIBLE WHEN YOUNG):</strong> Rough, hairy leaves, bell-shaped drooping flowers in clusters (not on spike), always opposite leaf arrangement</li><li><strong>KEY DIFFERENCE:</strong> Leaf arrangement—foxglove has alternate leaves (one per node alternating), comfrey has opposite leaves (pairs facing each other)</li></ul><h4>Morel Mushrooms - True vs. False</h4><ul><li><strong>True Morels (edible):</strong> Completely hollow interior when cut in half lengthwise—cavity runs from cap to stem with no internal structures</li><li><strong>False Morels (toxic):</strong> Have cotton-like filling inside or chambers when cut in half</li><li><strong>CRITICAL TEST:</strong> Cut mushroom in half lengthwise before eating—true morels reveal hollow chamber, false morels show cotton-like material</li><li><strong>DO NOT eat any morel without the hollow test—false morels cause severe GI upset</strong></li></ul><h4>Pokeweed - Only Young Shoots Edible, Mature Plant Toxic</h4><ul><li><strong>Young pokeweed shoots (edible ONLY if prepared correctly):</strong> Resemble asparagus, reddish color, must be boiled twice with water changes, discard all water</li><li><strong>Mature pokeweed plant (TOXIC):</strong> Tall plant 3-8 feet, berries are dark purple/black, all mature parts are poisonous including roots, seeds, berries</li><li><strong>CRITICAL:</strong> Only harvest young shoots (under 8 inches tall) in early spring, and boil twice with fresh water to remove toxins</li></ul><h4>Rhubarb Leaves vs. Stalks</h4><ul><li><strong>Rhubarb leaf blades (TOXIC):</strong> Large leaves contain high oxalic acid and other toxins—cause kidney failure if consumed in quantity</li><li><strong>Rhubarb stalks (EDIBLE):</strong> Red/pink stalks are safe when cooked, use only the stalk portion</li><li><strong>CRITICAL:</strong> Never eat rhubarb leaves under any circumstances—leaves are deadly</li></ul><h4>Acorn Tannin Leaching - Required for Safety</h4><ul><li><strong>Raw acorns (TOXIC):</strong> Contain high tannin concentrations causing stomach pain and damage</li><li><strong>Proper processing:</strong> Shell, crush, soak in running water 1-3 days or boil in multiple water changes until not bitter</li><li><strong>Taste test during leaching:</strong> Sample small piece—should taste slightly sweet, not bitter</li></ul><h4>Shellfish Red Tide - Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP)</h4><ul><li><strong>Red tide conditions:</strong> Water appears reddish or brown from algal bloom</li><li><strong>CRITICAL RULE:</strong> DO NOT EAT SHELLFISH (clams, mussels, oysters, scallops) when water is discolored or reddish</li><li><strong>PSP toxins:</strong> Cause progressive paralysis, respiratory failure—NO ANTIDOTE EXISTS</li><li><strong>Cooking does NOT destroy PSP toxins</strong></li><li><strong>Safe harvesting:</strong> Only harvest shellfish from clean, clear, non-blooming waters</li></ul><h4>Deadly Nightshade/Baneberry vs. Edible Berries</h4><ul><li><strong>Deadly Nightshade:</strong> Bell-shaped purple flowers, shiny black berries, unpleasant smell. EXTREMELY TOXIC.</li><li><strong>Baneberry:</strong> White or red berries on upright stems. DEADLY TOXIC.</li><li><strong>Safe Berries:</strong> Blackberry (thorny brambles), blueberry (low plant), wild strawberry (small berries on low plant).</li></ul><h4>Water Hemlock vs. Wild Edibles</h4><ul><li><strong>Water Hemlock:</strong> Smooth hairless stems with red blotches, musty smell, chambered hollow root sections. FATAL IN TINY AMOUNTS.</li><li><strong>Watercress:</strong> Small round leaflets, aquatic plant, peppery taste, no red blotches.</li><li><strong>Wild Parsnip:</strong> Hairy stems, yellow flowers, distinct parsnip smell.</li></ul><h3>Unknown Plants Rule</h3><ul><li>Never eat any plant without absolutely certain identification</li><li>If any doubt exists, do not consume</li><li>Consult multiple field guides and experienced foragers</li><li>Photograph and get expert verification before eating</li><li>Test for oral irritation: place small amount on lip 15 minutes before eating (causes burning if toxic)</li></ul><p class="warning">Poisoning Symptoms: Abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, burning mouth/throat, tremors, irregular heartbeat. If poisoning suspected, call poison control immediately: (800) 222-1222 in US. DO NOT induce vomiting.</p></section><section id="preparation"><h2>Preparation Methods</h2><p>Proper preparation ensures safety and maximizes nutrition.
