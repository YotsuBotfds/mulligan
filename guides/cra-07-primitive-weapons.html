Single bow takes 20-40 hours to craft but lasts decades with care.</p><h3>Wood Selection:</h3><ul><li><strong>Yew:</strong> Superior elasticity; traditional bow wood. White sapwood bends easily; dark heartwood provides backing support. Limited availability in some regions.</li><li><strong>Ash:</strong> Good flexibility; readily available in temperate forests. Less dense than yew but adequate for hunting bows.</li><li><strong>Elm:</strong> Acceptable alternative; strong heartwood provides backing support.</li><li><strong>Avoid:</strong> Pine, spruce (too flexible, won't store energy); oak (too brittle, shatters)</li></ul><h3>Stave Preparation:</h3><ol><li>Select straight-grained branch 2-3 inches diameter, 5-6 feet long</li><li>Split log (quarter or half—avoid pith which creates weakness)</li><li>Allow drying 2-4 weeks (green wood becomes less brittle as water evaporates)</li><li>Scrape/plane to remove bark and partial sapwood (exposes uniform surface)</li><li>Shape to taper: thicker at center (handle), thinner at tips</li></ol><h3>Bow Profile Design:</h3><p>Recurved bow (tips curve away from archer) stores more energy in shorter length. Straight bow is simpler to make. Longbow (6+ feet tall) efficient; shorter bow (3-4 feet) easier to handle in brush.</p><h3>Bow Assembly:</h3><ol><li>Create handle (grip) at center: 1.2 inches diameter, 4-5 inches long</li><li>Taper limbs: reduce diameter from handle to tip (1/8 inch at tips)</li><li>Test thickness by attempting to bend (should bend uniformly without cracking)</li><li>Create nocks (grooves for string at tip ends)</li><li>String with sinew, plant fiber, or manufactured cord (minimum 50 lb pull weight)</li><li>Test draw: archer should draw smoothly 28 inches with good back muscles</li></ol><h3>Bow Draw Weight & Hunting Effectiveness:</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Draw Weight</th><th scope="row">Hunting Suitability</th><th scope="row">Effective Distance</th></tr><tr><td>30-40 lb</td><td>Small game only</td><td>20-30m</td></tr><tr><td>40-60 lb</td><td>Medium game (deer)</td><td>25-40m</td></tr><tr><td>60+ lb</td><td>Large game (elk, moose)</td><td>30-50m</td></tr></table></section><section id="arrow-making"><h2>Arrow Crafting</h2><p>Quality arrows determine bow effectiveness. Poorly made arrows miss targets; well-made arrows fly true and penetrate deeply.</p><h3>Shaft Material:</h3><ul><li><strong>Straight wood:</strong> Hazel, birch, or ash. Requires selecting completely straight sections. Soak then straighten while drying (tedious but effective).</li><li><strong>Bamboo:</strong> Natural straight grain; naturally light weight; strongest material available</li><li><strong>Cane/reed:</strong> Adequate if arrow selected for straightness</li></ul><h3>Arrow Construction Sequence:</h3><ol><li><strong>Shaft selection:</strong> Choose straight material 5-6mm diameter, 28 inches long</li><li><strong>Fletching:</strong> Attach feathers (goose, turkey, or other large bird feathers) at rear. Typical: three fletches at 120-degree spacing, 2-3 inches long</li><li><strong>Binding:</strong> Wrap plant fiber or sinew around fletches to secure them (0.5 inches above and below attachment)</li><li><strong>Nock:</strong> Cut notch at rear (fits on bowstring). Typical notch: 1/2 inch deep, fits string snugly</li><li><strong>Broadhead attachment:</strong> Tie or glue stone/bone/metal point to front (see point-making guides below)</li><li><strong>Spine test:</strong> Arrow should deflect slightly under own weight when held horizontally</li></ol><h3>Arrow Points:</h3><p><strong>Bone points:</strong> Sharp, piercing well but brittle. Typical size: 1-2 inches long, small barbs for grip.</p><p><strong>Flint/stone points:</strong> Extremely sharp but fragile. Smaller than bone; require fine knapping skill.</p><p><strong>Metal points:</strong> If available, iron points vastly superior. Triple the penetration of bone at same draw weight.</p><h3>Accuracy Practice:</h3><p>Begin shooting at 10-15m range. Groups should tighten as archer develops muscle memory. Expect 10-30m effective hunting distance after 50+ hours practice. Competition archers achieve excellent accuracy; survival hunters need basic competence.</p></section><section id="atlatl"><h2>Atlatl (Spear-Thrower)</h2><p>Atlatl extends arm length mechanically, increasing spear velocity 2-3x compared to hand throw. Effective hunting weapon for mid-size game.</p><h3>Atlatl Construction:</h3><ol><li><strong>Shaft:</strong> Hardwood, 20-24 inches long, 1 inch diameter. Must be straight and balanced.</li><li><strong>Handle:</strong> Carved groove fitting archer's hand. Proper grip critical for control.</li><li><strong>Hook/socket:</strong> Rear end has hook or socket receiving spear butt. Hook design: 1-inch projection from shaft.</li><li><strong>Counterweight:</strong> Optional stone or bone weight 5-10 inches from hook (improves leverage and accuracy). Weight: 2-3 pounds typical.</li><li><strong>Strap:</strong> Leather or fiber strap connecting atlatl to archer's fingers (allows controlled release).</li></ol><h3>Spear Design (For Atlatl Use):</h3><p>Shorter than hand-thrown spear (5-7 feet vs. 8-12 feet). Must balance on atlatl hook. Weight concentrated forward (heavy point). Rear butt fits hook precisely (sloppy fit reduces accuracy).</p><h3>Throwing Technique:</h3><p>Overhead motion similar to baseball pitch. Atlatl extends arm and stores energy in flex. Release occurs when arm extended forward; hook releases spear with high velocity. Effective distance: 40-80m for accuracy; kills at 30-50m.</p><h3>Advantages vs. Bow:</h3><ul><li>Heavier projectile penetrates deeper (larger game capability)</li><li>Shorter learning curve (basic competence in 20-30 hours)</li><li>Less training required for consistent accuracy</li><li>Easier to manufacture (fewer precision requirements)</li></ul></section><section id="sling"><h2>Sling Construction & Use</h2><p>Sling propels projectile (stone or clay ball) with surprising velocity. Roman soldiers with slings were formidable soldiers. Concealable weapon requiring minimal materials.</p><h3>Sling Construction:</h3><ol><li><strong>Pouch:</strong> Leather or woven fabric rectangle, 4x3 inches</li><li><strong>Cords:</strong> Two cords of equal length (24-30 inches), attached to pouch ends</li><li><strong>Release knot:</strong> One cord has knot tied at end (held by pinky/ring finger). Other cord has loop (held by thumb/forefinger).</li><li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> Lead balls (1-2 ounces) ideal; smooth stones adequate</li></ol><h3>Sling Operation:</h3><ol><li>Place projectile in pouch</li><li>Hold sling by both cords (knot in one hand, loop in other)</li><li>Swing overhead in figure-eight motion (builds rotational speed)</li><li>Complete 2-3 full rotations</li><li>Release loop-end cord; knot remains held</li><li>Projectile launches at 60-90 m/s velocity</li></ol><h3>Accuracy & Lethality:</h3><p>Effective distance: 30-60m for accurate shooting (difficult to master). Head shot kills; body shots stun or injure. Skilled slingers (professional soldiers) achieved remarkable accuracy. Modern recreation slingers consistently hit targets at 40m.</p></section><section id="spear-making"><h2>Spear & Lance Making</h2><p>Spears are most fundamental hunting weapons: simple, reliable, effective. Multiple points allow hunting with multiple spears without constant retrieval.</p><h3>Hunting Spear (Hand-Thrown or Jabbing):</h3><ol><li><strong>Shaft:</strong> Straight wood 8-12 feet long, 1-1.5 inches diameter. Ash preferred (flexible, won't break).</li><li><strong>Balance:</strong> Point weight 1-2 ounces; total spear 3-5 pounds. Balance point 1/3 from point end (ensures point-forward flight).</li><li><strong>Point attachment:</strong> Bind bone/stone point with sinew using spiral binding (wraps prevent point rotation).</li><li><strong>Grip section:</strong> Leave 1-2 inches of shaft bare (hand contact area). Grip should be slightly thinner than shaft (easier to grasp).</li></ol><h3>Fishing Spear (Multi-Pronged):</h3><p>2-4 bone/wood prongs spreading 4-6 inches wide at point. Prongs 6-8 inches long; slightly barbed to catch fish. Spring assembly holds prongs together until fish impact spreads them (holding fish on prongs). Effective to 2-3 meter depth in clear water.</p><h3>War Lance (Mounted Use):</h3><p>Long spear (10-12 feet) designed for mounted warriors. Heavy point (4-8 ounces) stored energy from horse momentum. Shaft tapered to control weight distribution. Point narrower than hunting spear (penetrates armor).</p></section><section id="traps"><h2>Mechanical Trap Systems</h2><p>Traps allow hunting without constant presence. Effective for small-to-medium game. Design determines species caught.</p><h3>Deadfall Trap:</h3><ol><li><strong>Framework:</strong> Heavy log, rock, or wooden structure (10-100 pounds depending on game)</li><li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Balanced stick holding deadfall suspended above game path</li><li><strong>Bait:</strong> Placed under deadfall, attached to trigger stick</li><li><strong>Operation:</strong> Animal pulls bait; trigger releases; deadfall falls killing animal instantly</li><li><strong>Setting:</strong> Requires careful balance; deadfall must fall cleanly without getting stuck</li></ol><h3>Snare Trap:</h3><ol><li><strong>Loop:</strong> Cordage formed into running loop (diameter matches target animal)</li><li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Hook or bent stick supporting loop, releasing when disturbed</li><li><strong>Anchor:</strong> Secured to fixed point (tree, stake) preventing escape</li><li><strong>Placement:</strong> Set where animals naturally travel (game trail)</li><li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Strangles or holds animal until trapper arrives</li></ol><h3>Pit Trap:</h3><ol><li><strong>Dig:</strong> Hole 2-3 meters deep in game trail</li><li><strong>Disguise:</strong> Cover with light branches and leaves (hides hole from sight)</li><li><strong>Stakes:</strong> Optional sharpened stakes at bottom (increases lethality)</li><li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Large animals (deer, boar) fall and are trapped. Small animals may escape.</li></ol><h3>Fish Trap (Weir):</h3><p>Stone/wood structure in stream creating funnel leading into enclosure. Fish naturally swim upriver; funnel design prevents escape. Effective in streams with seasonal fish migrations.</p></section><section id="defensive"><h2>Defensive Weapons</h2><h3>Shield Design:</h3><p>Wooden frame (1.5-2m tall for body protection) covered with hide or woven material. Central boss (metal or wood) deflects blows. Weight: 4-8 pounds (requires strength for extended holding). Effective against primitive weapons (spears, arrows).</p><h3>Club/Mace:</h3><p>Hardwood shaft with heavy head (stone, bone, or metal). Simple and lethal. No maintenance required (unlike swords which need sharpening). Effective up to 3-4 meter range if mounted on horse.</p><h3>Armor Concepts:</h3><p>Leather armor (boiled/hardened) deflects slashing attacks. Multiple layers provide protection. Heavy armor (metal) is superior but requires metalworking capability (see forging guides). Helmet reduces head strike severity.</p></section><section id="safety"><h2>Safety Considerations</h2><p>Primitive weapons are lethal. Accidents cause death or permanent injury. Practice safety protocols always.</p><h3>Archery Safety:</h3><ul><li>Never nock arrow unless shooting</li><li>Always check target and beyond for people</li><li>Shoot only on designated range with clear 100m+ safety zone</li><li>Retrieve arrows only when no one shooting</li><li>Never draw bow at person unless defending life</li></ul><h3>Spear/Atlatl Safety:</h3><ul><li>Clear throwing area completely before using</li><li>Establish 100m+ radius safety zone</li><li>Warn people before throwing</li><li>Never retrieve while others might throw</li></ul><h3>Trap Safety:</h3><ul><li>Mark trap locations (prevents accidental triggering)</li><li>Check traps daily (prevents spoilage, unnecessary animal suffering)</li><li>Use minimum force necessary (kills instantly vs. slow death)</li><li>Remove unsuccessful traps to prevent non-target captures</li></ul></section><section id="common-mistakes"><h2>Common Mistakes & Solutions</h2><h3>Mistake 1: Poorly Shaped Bow Limbs</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Bows with uneven limb thickness. Thicker limb stores more energy, bends less, resulting in off-target shots.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Test bend by hand before completing bow. Both limbs should bend identically under same force. Sand/scrape to equalize thickness.</p><h3>Mistake 2: Improper Arrow Spine</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Arrows too stiff or too flexible for bow draw weight. Stiff arrows fly left; flexible arrows fly right.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Test arrows by bending by hand (should match bow stiffness feel). Adjust fletching balance or weight to correct flight.</p><h3>Mistake 3: Weak Trap Construction</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Animal escapes trap due to loose binding or weak trigger mechanism. Wasted effort and animal suffering.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Test trigger before setting live bait. Use multiple binding/rope passes. Ensure deadfall/snare cannot be pushed open by animal thrashing.</p></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="bone-tools.html">Bone Tool Making (for Points)</a><a href="stone-tools.html">Stone Tool Making (for Points)</a><a href="cra-03-cordage-textiles.html">Cordage Making (for Binding)</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
