Ore and charcoal loaded into pit furnace, heated to 1100-1350°C by air blast. Iron cannot fully melt at this temperature (melting point 1538°C) but becomes plastic/spongy, allowing slag to drain away. Final product: 15-30kg iron bloom per furnace run, requiring 3-4 days of initial ore/charcoal consumption and hammering consolidation.</p><p>Advantages: simple construction (clay/stone available most locations), fuel-efficient relative to output, produces wrought iron (pure, malleable, weldable), scalable from household backyard to village operation. Disadvantages: slow (8-12 hours active smelting per run), labor-intensive (constant bellows operation required), low reduction efficiency (20-30% ore converts to usable iron), requires extensive post-smelting hammering.</p><svg viewbox='0 0 500 550' style='background:#1a2e1a;margin:20px 0;border-radius:8px;max-width:100%;height:auto' aria-label='Bloomery Furnace Construction diagram 1'><rect width="500" height="550" fill="#1a2e1a"></rect><text x="250" y="30" fill="#d4a574" font-size="18" font-weight="bold" text-anchor="middle">Bloomery Furnace Cross-Section</text><ellipse cx="250" cy="200" rx="100" ry="120" fill="none" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2/"><text x="250" y="180" fill="#d4a574" font-size="11" font-weight="bold" text-anchor="middle">Furnace Pit</text><text x="250" y="195" fill="#d4a574" font-size="10" text-anchor="middle">D: 1-1.2m</text><text x="250" y="210" fill="#d4a574" font-size="10" text-anchor="middle">Depth: 0.8-1m</text><rect x="150" y="280" width="200" height="80" fill="#8b5a2b" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2/"><text x="250" y="310" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="11" text-anchor="middle">Iron Bloom (Hot)</text><text x="250" y="325" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="10" text-anchor="middle">Consolidation Area</text><rect x="160" y="360" width="180" height="40" fill="#4a4a4a" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="1/"><text x="250" y="380" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="10" text-anchor="middle">Slag Layer (Molten)</text><line x1="220" y1="320" x2="180" y2="350" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="2/"><line x1="280" y1="320" x2="320" y2="350" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="2/"><text x="160" y="340" fill="#d4a574" font-size="9">Slag drain holes</text><path d='M 100 200 L 80 200 L 75 210' stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="3" fill="none"></path><text x="50" y="190" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="9">Air pipe inlet</text><text x="50" y="205" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="8"">(from bellows)</text><rect x="280" y="80" width="80" height="120" fill="none" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2" stroke-dasharray="3,3"></rect><text x="320" y="125" fill="#d4a574" font-size="10" text-anchor="middle">Ore/Charcoal</text><text x="320" y="140" fill="#d4a574" font-size="9" text-anchor="middle">Stack</text><text x="320" y="155" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="8" text-anchor="middle">(Layered)</text><circle cx="250" cy="60" r="20" fill="none" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2/"><text x="250" y="65" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="9" text-anchor="middle">Top</text><text x="250" y="80" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="8" text-anchor="middle">(Open)</text><path d='M 130 100 L 110 85 M 160 100 L 140 85 M 190 100 L 170 85' stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="2/"><text x="70" y="110" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="8">Flame exhaust</text></svg></section><section id="materials"><h2>Material Selection and Preparation</h2><p>Bloomery construction requires heat-resistant materials capable of withstanding 1100-1350°C for extended periods.</p><h3>Furnace Pit Lining</h3><p><strong>Clay:</strong> Primary material. Needs high refractory clay (kaolin, fireclay) if available, or local clay with >20% silica. Test: form ball, heat to bright red (800°C), should not slump. Common clay acceptable but erodes faster (replaced annually). Best clay: from pottery makers, fire clay bricks if obtainable.</p><p><strong>Stone:</strong> Use in outer shell for structural strength. Granite, basalt, or river stone (not limestone - decomposes at 900°C and destroys furnace). Stack 20-30cm thick around clay lining. Stones should be fist-sized or larger for efficient packing.</p><p><strong>Clay preparation:</strong> Dig clay (if needed), dry completely (1-2 weeks in sun), crush to powder, wet to workable putty consistency (40-50% water by weight). Mix sand 1:4 ratio (1 clay : 4 sand by volume) to reduce cracking during drying. Tread or knead 30-60 minutes to homogenize. Result: tempered clay ready for molding.</p><h3>Bellows Construction</h3><p><strong>Air pump required:</strong> Simple box bellows: wooden frame 0.5x0.5m, depth 0.2m, leather bag (or heavy burlap) seal, handle for pumping. One-way valves (simple leather flaps) allow air in on upstroke, discharge on downstroke. Rate: 10-20 strokes/minute produces 0.5-1 m³/minute air flow at 20-30 kPa pressure - adequate for bloomery. Replaces every 2-3 years (leather deteriorates).</p><p><strong>Air pipe:</strong> Clay or metal tube 5-10cm diameter, leads from bellows to furnace pit, ends inside pit 10-15cm above bloom consolidation level. Pipe must withstand 1100°C without cracking - higher-quality refractory clay used only for pipe interior 5cm section inside furnace; remainder can be standard clay.</p></section><section id="dimensions"><h2>Optimal Dimensions</h2><p>Size balances efficiency with constructability and operator capability.</p><table><tr><th scope="row">Parameter<th scope="row">Dimension<th scope="row">Rationale<tr><td>Pit diameter<td>1.0-1.2m<td>Larger = more ore capacity, harder to manage temperature. Smaller = limited bloom size<tr><td>Pit depth<td>0.8-1.0m<td>Deep enough for 100-150L ore/charcoal charge. Shallow = lower capacity; deep = heat loss, slower heating<tr><td>Pit wall thickness<td>20-30cm<td>Clay 10-15cm, stone backing 10-15cm. Thickness insulates, prevents breach<tr><td>Dome height<td>0.5-0.8m<td>Traps heat, allows space for flame. Low = cramped; high = heat escapes<tr><td>Air pipe entry<td>5-8cm diameter<td>Adequate flow without excessive velocity (>3 m/s causes turbulence)<tr><td>Air pipe height<td>30-40cm above bottom<td>Submerged enough to reach reaction zone, high enough to avoid slag drowning</table></section><section id="construction"><h2>Step-by-Step Construction</h2><h3>Phase 1: Pit Excavation (Days 1-2)</h3><ol><li>Mark circular area 1.2m diameter<li>Excavate pit 1.0m deep with vertical walls<li>Flatten bottom, compact soil<li>Dig three drain holes at pit bottom (5-8cm diameter) sloped slightly outward - drains slag after cooling</ol><h3>Phase 2: Stone Foundation (Day 2-3)</h3><ol><li>Line pit bottom with large stones (fist-sized, ~10cm layer) - base<li>Begin stacking stone walls up pit sides, using clay mortar between stones (same clay as furnace lining)<li>Stack vertically as high as ground level (~1m), compact stones with clay mortar</ol><h3>Phase 3: Clay Lining (Day 3-4)</h3><ol><li>Apply 10-15cm clay lining to inside of stone pit - press firmly to eliminate gaps<li>Smooth interior to eliminate cracks and voids (cracks allow gas bypass, reducing efficiency)<li>Allow to dry 1-2 days (cover with straw to prevent fast drying which causes cracking)<li>Install air pipe: push clay tube through wall 20-30cm above pit bottom, angled slightly downward from outside<li>Seal around pipe with clay mortar, compact thoroughly</ol><h3>Phase 4: Dome Construction (Days 4-5)</h3><ol><li>Create dome frame: dome shape can be built free-form (easier) or using clay brick arch form<li>Free-form: hand-stack clay "bricks" (20x10x5cm size, sun-dried or fired if available) in domed pattern, starting at rim and angling inward/upward at 10° tilt per layer<li>Dome height: 0.6-0.8m above rim. Crown opens 0.3m diameter hole at top for flame exhaust<li>Smooth interior clay joints, eliminate voids<li>Cure 2-3 days slow dry (cover partially with straw to prevent cracking)</ol><h3>Phase 5: Surroundings Setup (Day 5)</h3><ol><li>Build bellows system adjacent to furnace pit (see section below)<li>Connect bellows to air pipe with wooden/clay tube<li>Build ore/charcoal storage area 5m away (prevents flying sparks/ash from entering materials)<li>Construct work area with anvil, tongs, hammer (needed for bloom consolidation)</ol><h3>Phase 6: Curing (Days 5-7)</h3><p>Allow furnace to cure fully at room temperature for 2-3 days before first firing. Slow heating in first run: keep fire at 600-700°C for first 2 hours, gradually increase to full operating temperature. Rapid heating causes cracks/breaches.</p></section><section id="bellows"><h2>Bellows System</h2><h3>Simple Wooden Box Bellows</h3><p>Dimensions: 0.5m x 0.5m x 0.2m deep. Construction: wooden frame (pine or hardwood beams 5x5cm), two leather bags (or canvas for less-durable substitute) - one on each side of center baffle. Operation: push down on top, air drawn through lower leather flap valve into chamber; pull up, upper flap opens and air discharged through discharge tube into furnace pipe.</p><p>Each stroke: ~10-15 liters air. Steady strokes at 15 per minute = 150-225 liters/minute = 0.25-0.375 m³/minute adequate flow for bloomery.</p><h3>Bellows Maintenance</h3><p>Leather seals deteriorate 18-24 months of regular use. Signs of failure: pressure drops (bellows less responsive), air leaks visible/audible around seams. Replacement: soak old leather in water (1 day) to soften, remove, measure, cut replacement leather from large animal hide (cow), reinstall with copper rivets or stitching. Cost: minimal if hides available locally.</p><h3>Alternative: Foot Bellows</h3><p>If labor-intensive hand bellows infeasible: foot-operated pump using two foot pedals operates two chambers alternately. Operator stands on pedals rhythmically, hands free for other tasks. Less familiar but effective - used in traditional Asian smelting.</p></section><section id="operation"><h2>Charging and Operation Sequence</h2><h3>Charge Calculation</h3><p>For 1m³ furnace pit (nominal capacity):</p><ul><li>Roasted iron ore: 100-120kg (hematite Fe₂O₃ preferred)<li>Charcoal: 30-40kg (finely broken, 5-10cm pieces)<li>Clay/limestone flux (optional): 5-10kg (aids slag fusion)</ul><p>Total volume: about 150-160L packed loosely, fits pit comfortably.</p><h3>Charging Procedure (Day of Smelting)</h3><ol><li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Assemble all materials nearby. Charcoal should be dry (store under cover). Ore should be dry and roasted (800°C for 2 hours reduces some moisture, improves reactivity)<li><strong>Base layer:</strong> Place 10cm charcoal at pit bottom, spread evenly<li><strong>Alternate layers:</strong> Add 15cm ore layer, then 10cm charcoal, then ore, repeat until pit nearly full (10-15cm headspace at top)<li><strong>Start fire:</strong> Light top charcoal layer with kindling (dry wood), allow flame 30 minutes to establish<li><strong>Begin air blast:</strong> Start gentle bellows operation at 5-10 strokes/minute (slow, warming furnace gradually). Increase to 15 strokes/minute after 30 minutes when flame established<li><strong>Add ore:</strong> As materials burn down, periodically add new ore/charcoal layers (every 30-60 minutes) maintaining furnace fullness. Typical run: 4-6 ore additions over 8-hour period</ol><h3>Operational Duration</h3><p>Continuous operation 8-12 hours typical. Constant bellows operation required. Requires 2-3 person team: (1) bellows operator (most physically demanding), (2) charcoal feeder/temperature monitor, (3) general labor/preparation.</p></section><section id="temperature"><h2>Temperature Management</h2><p>Maintaining 1100-1350°C optimal zone critical. Temperature control by adjusting air blast rate and fuel addition rate.</p><h3>Temperature Indication (No Pyrometer)</h3><p>Observe color through furnace pit opening/viewing port:</p><table><tr><th scope="row">Color<th scope="row">Temperature (°C)<th scope="row">State<th scope="row">Action<tr><td>Dark red<td>700-900<td>Warming phase<td>Increase bellows, add fuel<tr><td>Bright cherry red<td>900-1100<td>Reduction zone<td>Increase bellows slowly<tr><td>Orange-red<td>1100-1300<td>Optimal zone<td>Maintain bellows, monitor<tr><td>Yellow-orange<td>1300-1400<td>Too hot<td>Reduce bellows, check for escape<tr><td>White (very rare)<td>>1400<td>Critical risk<td>Stop operation, inspect damage</table><p>Observe flame color at furnace top: bright yellow/orange flame = good combustion and likely good temperature. Dark/red flame = lower temperature. Flame should roar when bellows operated (sound of vigorous oxidation).</p><h3>Heat Loss Prevention</h3><p>Draft control: cover furnace top opening with straw/clay board to reduce heat loss, leave 10-15cm opening for flame exhaust. Excessive draft (windy location) cools furnace - build windbreak 2-3m away upwind. Cold air from bellows intake can cool furnace if located too close - locate bellows 2-3m away, insulate air pipe with straw wrapping to preheat air.</p></section><section id="extraction"><h2>Bloom Extraction and Consolidation</h2><p>After 8-12 hour smelting run, furnace must cool or bloom extracted while hot.</p><h3>Hot Extraction (Traditional)</h3><ol><li><strong>Stop bellows:</strong> Cease air blast, allow furnace to rest 10-30 minutes<li><strong>Prepare tools:</strong> Have large flat prying bar (1m long steel rod or wooden beam), tongs, wooden sledge/hammer ready<li><strong>Drain slag:</strong> Use long rod to punch through one of the bottom drain holes, breaking the solidified slag plug. Molten slag flows out - be alert for danger (flows away but very hot, 1000°C+)<li><strong>Extract bloom:</strong> Using long prying bar and tongs, carefully work under the bloom mass. Try to lift entire mass in one piece - very heavy (50-100kg) and very hot (800-900°C). Place on flat stone or steel plate outdoors<li><strong>Cool briefly:</strong> Allow 2-5 minutes exposure to air to form initial oxide skin (prevents oxidation penetration), then douse with water if too hot to work</ol><h3>Consolidation Hammering</h3><p>Extracted bloom is spongy (porous, contains trapped slag and gas). Hammering while hot squeezes out slag, consolidates metal:</p><ol><li><strong>Reheat if cooled:</strong> If bloom cooled below red heat (<700°C), reheat in forge fire to bright cherry-red<li><strong>Strike:</strong> Place bloom on anvil (or large flat stone), strike with sledgehammer (4-6kg mass, 2-3 person operation: one operator hammer, one holding tongs repositioning bloom, one operating bellows for reheating). Strikes should be powerful, full-swing (not tapping)<li><strong>Pattern:</strong> Strike center, turn 90°, strike again, rotate, repeat in spiral pattern covering entire bloom<li><strong>Reheating:</strong> After 10-15 strikes, bloom cools below optimal working temperature (dark red), return to forge, reheat 15-30 minutes to bright cherry-red, resume hammering<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Total hammering 2-4 hours (repeated heating/hammering cycles). Continue until slag ceases to expel (observe no more slag particles flying from impacts) and bloom achieves dense appearance</ol><p>Final product: 20-30kg usable wrought iron from ~100kg ore charge (20-30% efficiency). Metal is relatively pure iron, soft and ductile, suitable for smithing into tools/weapons.</p></section><section id="yield-calculations"><h2>Yield Calculations</h2><p>Predicting iron output from ore charge helps assess viability.</p><h3>Ore Analysis</h3><p>Iron ore composition varies widely:</p><table><tr><th scope="row">Ore Type<th scope="row">Iron Content %<th scope="row">Typical Fe2O3 %<th scope="row">Gangue % (waste)<tr><td>Hematite (Fe₂O₃)<td>70%<td>100<td>~20% SiO₂<tr><td>Magnetite (Fe₃O₄)<td>72%<td>89<td>~15% SiO₂<tr><td>Limonite (Fe₂O₃·3H₂O)<td>40-60%<td>Varies<td>~40% H₂O + SiO₂<tr><td>Bog ore<td>20-40%<td>Varies<td>~50% organic matter</table><p><strong>Example:</strong> 100kg hematite (70% iron content) = 70kg pure iron. Bloomery efficiency ~25-30% = 17.5-21kg usable bloom extracted. After 10% hammering loss (slag expulsion) = 15-19kg final product.</p><p>Calculation: (Ore mass × iron content % × furnace efficiency) - hammering loss = final iron.</p><h3>Energy Requirements</h3><p>Charcoal consumption: 0.3-0.5kg charcoal per kg iron produced. 100kg ore charge requires 20-40kg charcoal, roughly 50-60 kg wood needed (wood carbonizes at ~20-25% efficiency). Heat value of charcoal ~29 MJ/kg; furnace captures ~20-25% as useful heat (rest lost as exhaust). Total energy: 1000-1500 MJ for 20kg iron = 50-75 MJ per kg iron - substantial energy input.</p></section><section id="maintenance"><h2>Maintenance and Reuse</h2><h3>Post-Run Inspection</h3><p>After each smelting run, allow furnace to cool completely (24-48 hours). Inspect interior for:</p><ul><li>Cracks in clay (common, resealable)<li>Breaches in wall (rare if constructed properly)<li>Slag adherence to walls (hardens as insulating layer, protects clay underneath)<li>Damage to dome (visible from interior by looking up through drain holes)</ul><h3>Crack Repair</h3><p>If small cracks (<1cm) observed: seal with clay mortar (same mix as lining). Clean crack with tool, wet thoroughly, force mortar deep into crack, smooth flush with surrounding surface, allow 1-2 days drying. Furnace ready for next run.</p><h3>Reuse Life</h3><p>Clay bloomery furnaces typically last 5-10 years with good maintenance (annual repairs, proper curing between runs). Stone backing prevents rapid deterioration. When clay becomes severely eroded (>20% thickness loss), rebuild interior lining (2-3 days labor). Slag layer buildup actually helps - provides additional insulation and wear protection.</p><h3>Seasonal Considerations</h3><p>Bloomeries work year-round but require more fuel in winter (furnace loses more heat). Spring/summer optimal - better weather for extended operation, less heating burden. Cold weather operation possible with additional charcoal allowance (20-30% more fuel) and covering furnace top to reduce heat loss.</p><div class="warning"><strong>Safety Critical:</strong> Bloomery smelting is extremely hot work. Burns are common from splashing slag or contact with bloom. Charcoal monoxide exposure (from bellows operation) can cause headaches - ensure good ventilation. Never leave furnace unattended during operation - can runaway to dangerous temperatures. Have water supply nearby for emergencies. Iron oxide dust from ore can cause respiration issues with prolonged exposure - dust mask recommended during charging.</div></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="steel-making.html">Steel Making Fundamentals</a> | <a href="metallurgy-basics.html">Metallurgy Basics</a> | <a href="metalworking.html">Metalworking & Smithing</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
