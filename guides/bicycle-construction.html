Why Bicycles </h2><p> The bicycle represents the most efficient form of human-powered transportation ever invented. Understanding its advantages clarifies why bicycles remain essential technology in developed and developing countries alike. </p><h3> Efficiency & Speed </h3><p> A cyclist requires only 1/4 the energy expenditure of a pedestrian covering the same distance at the same speed. Modern humans walking consume approximately 0.5 calories per kilogram per kilometer. A cyclist on a standard bicycle consumes only 0.12 calories per kilogram per kilometer — a <strong> 3-4x efficiency gain </strong> . This means an average person on a bicycle can travel 30-50 km on the caloric energy of a single meal, matching or exceeding walking energy cost over 2-3 times greater distances. </p><h3> Economic & Environmental Benefits </h3><ul><li><strong> No fuel required: </strong> Bicycles convert human muscle power directly. No petroleum, electricity grid, or biofuel dependency. </li><li><strong> Silent operation: </strong> Bicycles generate minimal noise, reducing acoustic pollution in shared spaces. </li><li><strong> Maintainable: </strong> All bicycle systems can be serviced with hand tools. No specialized electronic diagnostics or computer resets required. </li><li><strong> Cargo capacity: </strong> A standard bicycle carries 20-30 kg payload. Cargo bicycles and trailers increase capacity to 100+ kg. </li><li><strong> Horse replacement: </strong> One bicycle replaces a draft horse for local transport across flat to rolling terrain, with lower maintenance and food costs. </li><li><strong> Speed over distance: </strong> A cyclist on level terrain travels 5-8x faster than walking, covering practical commuting distances (5-20 km) in 15-60 minutes without fatigue that would accumulate during walking. </li></ul><h3> Versatility </h3><p> Bicycles serve as more than personal transport. The rotating wheel and pedal-driven drivetrain can power mills, pumps, generators, and workshop tools. A single bicycle can be reconfigured for different purposes: commuting, cargo hauling, racing, or stationary operation as a power source. This versatility makes bicycles fundamental to resilient local economies. </p><div class="tip"><strong> Key Insight: </strong> A person on a bicycle is the most energy-efficient moving organism on Earth — more efficient than any animal and vastly more efficient than any motor vehicle per unit payload delivered. </div></section><section class="section" id="anatomy"><h2> 2. Bicycle Anatomy </h2><p> Understanding the main systems of a bicycle is essential for construction, repair, and modification. Bicycles are modular assemblies, with major groups that can be independently designed and replaced. </p><h3> Frame </h3><p> The frame is the structural backbone of the bicycle. Steel frames remain the most durable and repairable choice for long-term use. </p><div class="spec-box"><strong> Frame components: </strong><ul><li><strong> Top tube: </strong> Horizontal member connecting seat tube to head tube; carries bending loads. </li><li><strong> Down tube: </strong> Diagonal member from head tube to bottom bracket shell; primary load path from steering forces. </li><li><strong> Seat tube: </strong> Vertical (or near-vertical) member from bottom bracket to seat post; carries rider weight. </li><li><strong> Chainstays: </strong> Pair of tubes from bottom bracket to rear axle; transmit pedal power to rear wheel. </li><li><strong> Seatstays: </strong> Pair of tubes from seat tube top area to rear axle; brace rear wheel; carry braking and torque loads. </li><li><strong> Head tube: </strong> Short vertical tube at front; houses the headset and fork steering bearing. </li><li><strong> Bottom bracket shell: </strong> Cylindrical housing where chainstays meet seat tube; contains crankset axle bearing. </li></ul></div><h3> Fork </h3><p> The fork is a two-legged suspension structure that holds the front wheel. Rigid forks are standard. The fork blade (leg) curves slightly to absorb vibration. The fork crown connects the two blades at the top, where they join the steerer tube that enters the head tube. </p><h3> Wheels </h3><div class="spec-box"><strong> Wheel components: </strong><ul><li><strong> Hub: </strong> Central cylindrical axle with two flanges (sides). Bearings allow the hub to rotate on the fixed axle. The flanges have holes for spoke attachment. </li><li><strong> Spokes: </strong> Thin metal rods (usually steel) under tension, radiating from hub flanges to rim. Typically 32-36 per wheel; carry tension to support wheel loads. </li><li><strong> Rim: </strong> Metal hoop (circular cross-section or I-beam profile) that holds the tire and provides structural stiffness. Rimbrake bicycles have flat braking surfaces; disc-brake wheels have centered hubs. </li><li><strong> Tire: </strong> Rubber covering (pneumatic or solid) that contacts the ground. Pneumatic tires have an inner tube filled with air; solid tires are one-piece rubber. </li></ul></div><h3> Drivetrain </h3><div class="spec-box"><strong> Drivetrain components: </strong><ul><li><strong> Pedals & cranks: </strong> Pedals are foot platforms attached to crank arms. Cranks rotate around the bottom bracket axle. Standard crank length is 170-175 mm. </li><li><strong> Chainring: </strong> Large sprocket with 30-50+ teeth mounted on the right crank. Pedal rotation turns the chainring. </li><li><strong> Chain: </strong> Roller chain (identical to industrial chain) that engages chainring and rear cog teeth. Standard 1/2" pitch (12.7 mm between roller centers). </li><li><strong> Freewheel or cassette: </strong> Stack of sprockets (cogs) at the rear hub. Allows coasting — the pedals stop when the wheel spins freely. </li><li><strong> Rear cog: </strong> Single sprocket or largest sprocket in cassette; driven by chain from chainring. </li></ul></div><h3> Steering System </h3><ul><li><strong> Handlebars: </strong> Grips where rider controls steering. Bar-end shifters or brake levers attach here. </li><li><strong> Stem: </strong> Connecting piece that mounts handlebars to the steerer tube. Adjustable angle allows reach/height customization. </li><li><strong> Headset: </strong> Bearing assembly in the head tube. Upper and lower bearings allow the fork to pivot smoothly. </li></ul><h3> Brakes </h3><ul><li><strong> Rim brakes: </strong> Pads press against the wheel rim from both sides (caliper) or one side (cantilever). Most common, easiest to service. </li><li><strong> Coaster brakes: </strong> Internal brake mechanism in rear hub. Pedaling backward engages brakes. Requires minimal maintenance; no brake cables. </li></ul></section><section class="section" id="frame-building"><h2> 3. Frame Building </h2><p> Building a bicycle frame requires precision geometry and reliable joinery. Steel remains the preferred material for durability and ease of repair. </p><h3> Material Selection </h3><p><strong> Chromoly steel (4130): </strong> Alloy steel with chromium and molybdenum. Stronger than mild steel, allowing thinner-walled tubing, lower weight, and excellent fatigue resistance. Industry standard for quality frames. Requires TIG welding or brazing with high-silver content filler. </p><p><strong> Mild steel: </strong> Plain carbon steel (1018-1030). Easier to braze with standard brass filler. Heavier than chromoly at the same wall thickness, but acceptable for cargo bicycles and repair work. Can be welded or brazed. </p><h3> Joinery Methods </h3><h4> Brazing </h4><p> Brazing joins tubes by melting brass filler (copper-zinc alloy) at 800-900°C. The filler is much stronger than solder but lower temperature than welding. </p><div class="spec-box"><strong> Brazing process: </strong><ol><li> Clean tube ends and joints with a file or sandpaper to remove oxidation. </li><li> Assemble the frame in a jig (see below) to maintain geometry. </li><li> Apply flux (borax-based) to joint surfaces. Flux prevents oxidation during heating. </li><li> Heat the joint with a torch (propane or acetylene). Direct flame toward the larger tube first; heat flows to the smaller tube. </li><li> When the tube reaches cherry-red color (~700°C), apply brass rod to the joint. Heat will melt the brass, flowing into the joint by capillary action. </li><li> Fully braze all sides of each tube junction until a continuous brass fillet is visible. </li><li> Cool slowly in air. Do not quench with water (risk of cracking). </li><li> Clean off flux residue with a wire brush once cool. </li></ol></div><h4> TIG Welding </h4><p> Gas tungsten arc welding (TIG/GTAW) produces strong, clean welds. Chromoly requires careful heat management and filler rod selection (ER70S-2 for chromoly). TIG equipment is expensive but produces professional results. </p><h3> Frame Jig </h3><p> A simple jig ensures alignment during construction. Assemble a flat surface (welding table or flat steel plate) with clamping blocks at critical positions: </p><ul><li> Bottom bracket area: Two parallel blocks support the seat tube and down tube at the correct angle. </li><li> Head tube area: Blocks establish the correct head angle (72-73°). </li><li> Rear dropout area: Blocks ensure chainstays and seatstays are parallel and perpendicular to the centerline. </li></ul><p> Use a level, square, and ruler to verify alignment before brazing or welding. </p><h3> Frame Geometry </h3><div class="diagram-container"><svg height="500" viewbox='0 0 400 500' width="400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label='BICYCLE CONSTRUCTION, REPAIR & BIKE-POWERED MACHINES diagram 1'><rect fill="#1f1f1f" height="500" stroke="#ff9800" stroke-width="2" width="400"></rect><text fill="#ffb74d" font-size="18" font-weight="bold" text-anchor="middle" x="200" y="25"> Bicycle Frame Geometry </text><line stroke="#ff9800" stroke-width="8" x1="100" x2="150" y1="100" y2="350"></line><line stroke="#ff9800" stroke-width="8" x1="100" x2="250" y1="100" y2="120"></line><line stroke="#ff9800" stroke-width="8" x1="250" x2="280" y1="120" y2="350"></line><line stroke="#ffb74d" stroke-width="6" x1="150" x2="310" y1="350" y2="350"></line><line stroke="#ffb74d" stroke-width="6" x1="280" x2="310" y1="350" y2="350"></line><line stroke="#ffb74d" stroke-width="6" x1="250" x2="310" y1="120" y2="350"></line><line stroke="#ff9800" stroke-width="8" x1="100" x2="115" y1="100" y2="180"></line><line stroke="#ffe0b2" stroke-dasharray="5,5" stroke-width="5" x1="100" x2="80" y1="100" y2="280"></line><line stroke="#ffe0b2" stroke-dasharray="5,5" stroke-width="5" x1="100" x2="130" y1="100" y2="280"></line><circle cx="150" cy="350" fill="#4caf50" r="5"></circle><text fill="#4caf50" font-size="12" x="155" y="365"> BB </text><circle cx="100" cy="100" fill="#4caf50" r="5"></circle><text fill="#4caf50" font-size="12" x="75" y="95"> HT </text><circle cx="250" cy="120" fill="#4caf50" r="5"></circle><text fill="#4caf50" font-size="12" x="260" y="115"> ST </text><circle cx="310" cy="350" fill="#4caf50" r="5"></circle><text fill="#4caf50" font-size="12" x="320" y="365"> RA </text><path d='M 250 150 Q 235 135 225 145' fill="none" stroke="#6bffb3" stroke-dasharray="3,3" stroke-width="2"></path><text fill="#6bffb3" font-size="12" x="215" y="150"> 72-74° </text><text fill="#b3e5b3" font-size="11" x="190" y="165"> (Seat Angle) </text><path d='M 105 120 Q 118 105 125 115' fill="none" stroke="#6bffb3" stroke-dasharray="3,3" stroke-width="2"></path><text fill="#6bffb3" font-size="12" x="130" y="110"> 72-73° </text><text fill="#b3e5b3" font-size="11" x="130" y="130"> (Head Angle) </text><line stroke="#ff6b6b" stroke-width="1" x1="50" x2="50" y1="420" y2="380"></line><line stroke="#ff6b6b" stroke-width="1" x1="50" x2="310" y1="380" y2="380"></line><line stroke="#ff6b6b" stroke-width="1" x1="310" x2="310" y1="420" y2="380"></line><text fill="#ff6b6b" font-size="12" text-anchor="middle" x="130" y="445"> Wheelbase (chainstay length) </text><line stroke="#ffb3b3" stroke-width="1" x1="20" x2="20" y1="350" y2="280"></line><line stroke="#ffb3b3" stroke-width="1" x1="15" x2="25" y1="350" y2="350"></line><line stroke="#ffb3b3" stroke-width="1" x1="15" x2="25" y1="280" y2="280"></line><text fill="#ffb3b3" font-size="11" x="35" y="320"> BB Height </text><text fill="#b3b3ff" font-size="11" x="20" y="480"> HT = Head Tube ST = Seat Tube BB = Bottom Bracket RA = Rear Axle </text></svg></div><div class="diagram-label"> Frame geometry defines handling and fit. Angles determine steering response; dimensions determine reach and standover clearance. </div><div class="spec-box"><strong> Critical geometry parameters: </strong><ul><li><strong> Seat angle: </strong> 72-74° from horizontal. Steeper angles (74°) place rider weight forward, aiding acceleration; shallower angles (72°) increase comfort on climbs. </li><li><strong> Head angle: </strong> 72-73° from horizontal. Steeper angles provide quicker steering response; shallower angles increase stability at speed. </li><li><strong> Chainstay length: </strong> 400-450 mm (measured from bottom bracket to rear axle centerline). Determines wheelbase. Shorter chainstays (400 mm) improve acceleration and climbing; longer chainstays (450 mm) improve stability and cargo carrying. </li><li><strong> Bottom bracket height: </strong> 250-300 mm above ground (measured from axle centerline to lowest frame point). Higher BB clearance reduces pedal strike on obstacles; lower BB improves stability and lowers center of gravity. </li><li><strong> Reach: </strong> Horizontal distance from seat tube to handlebar stem. Affects posture; longer reach (650+ mm) for racing, shorter reach (550 mm) for touring. </li><li><strong> Stack: </strong> Vertical distance from bottom bracket to handlebar center. Lower stack (500 mm) for racing, higher stack (600+ mm) for upright touring position. </li></ul></div><h3> Seat Tube Angle Effect on Geometry </h3><p> A steeper seat angle (74°) moves the rider forward relative to the crankset. This improves weight distribution over the front wheel, increasing traction during climbing and sprinting. A shallower seat angle (72°) extends reach, increasing comfort on long rides and improving stability. </p></section><section class="section" id="wheel-building"><h2> 4. Wheel Building </h2><p> A properly built wheel is strong, true (laterally and radially symmetric), and long-lasting. Wheel building requires precision but can be learned with practice. </p><h3> Hub </h3><p> The hub is the central rotating component. It consists of an axle (fixed or quick-release), two bearings (one on each side), and two flanges (the sides where spokes attach). The axle diameter determines spoke hole spacing and compatibility with frame dropouts. </p><div class="tip"><strong> Bearing maintenance: </strong> Hubs use ball bearings (usually 9 balls per side on 100mm road axles). Cones and cups hold the balls under tension. Periodically disassemble, clean, and repack with waterproof grease to prevent rust. </div><h3> Spokes </h3><p> Spokes are thin steel rods (typically 2.0-2.3 mm diameter for road bicycles) under high tension. Each spoke connects a hub flange to a rim hole. </p><h4> Spoke Selection & Preparation </h4><ul><li><strong> Length calculation: </strong> Spoke length depends on rim diameter, hub flange diameter, and spoke count. Standard formula: spoke hole diameter + rim radius + hub flange offset to hole. </li><li><strong> Salvaging spokes: </strong> Old bicycle wheels can be disassembled for spokes. Measure existing spokes with a spoke length gauge or ruler; threads are universal but lengths vary by 0.5-1 mm. </li><li><strong> Threaded ends: </strong> Some spokes have pre-rolled threads. Others require threading with a spoke threader if not salvaged with threads intact. </li></ul><h3> Rim </h3><p> Modern rims are usually aluminum extrusion or drawn steel. The rim is a circular metal strip with holes for spoke insertion. Rim tape (adhesive or clincher tape) covers spoke holes and protects inner tubes from sharp spoke ends. </p><p><strong> DIY rim construction: </strong> A simple rim can be bent from a flat steel strip (12-16 mm wide, 2 mm thick). Heat the strip to cherry-red, bend to desired diameter using a bending jig, and braze the joint where ends meet. Drill spoke holes in a grid pattern (typically 36 holes for standard 36-spoke wheels). </p><h3> Spoke Lacing </h3><p> Spoke lacing determines how each spoke connects the hub flange to the rim. The most common pattern is <strong> 3-cross lacing: </strong> each spoke crosses exactly 3 other spokes between hub and rim. This balances strength, flexibility, and stress distribution. </p><div class="diagram-container"><svg height="450" viewbox='0 0 450 450' width="450" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label='BICYCLE CONSTRUCTION, REPAIR & BIKE-POWERED MACHINES diagram 2'><rect fill="#1f1f1f" height="450" stroke="#ff9800" stroke-width="2" width="450"></rect><text fill="#ffb74d" font-size="18" font-weight="bold" text-anchor="middle" x="225" y="25"> 3-Cross Spoke Lacing Pattern </text><circle cx="225" cy="225" fill="none" r="180" stroke="#ffb74d" stroke-width="3"></circle><circle cx="225" cy="225" fill="none" r="60" stroke="#ff9800" stroke-width="3"></circle><circle cx="225" cy="225" fill="#4caf50" r="4"></circle><g id="rim-holes"><circle cx="405" cy="225" fill="#ffe0b2" r="4"></circle><circle cx="398" cy="239" fill="#ffe0b2" r="4"></circle><circle cx="384" cy="251" fill="#ffe0b2" r="4"></circle><circle cx="367" cy="261" fill="#ffe0b2" r="4"></circle><circle cx="348" cy="267" fill="#ffe0b2" r="4"></circle><circle cx="327" cy="270" fill="#ffe0b2" r="4"></circle><circle cx="306" cy="270" fill="#ffe0b2" r="4"></circle><circle cx="284" cy="267" fill="#ffe0b2" r="4"></circle><circle cx="263" cy="261" fill="#ffe0b2" r="4"></circle><circle cx="244" cy="251" fill="#ffe0b2" r="4"></circle></g><g id="hub-holes"><rect fill="#ffb3b3" height="8" width="8" x="221" y="163"></rect><rect fill="#ffb3b3" height="8" width="8" x="253" y="173"></rect><rect fill="#ffb3b3" height="8" width="8" x="280" y="193"></rect><rect fill="#ffb3b3" height="8" width="8" x="300" y="221"></rect><rect fill="#ffb3b3" height="8" width="8" x="310" y="255"></rect></g><line stroke="#6bffb3" stroke-width="2" x1="225" x2="280" y1="165" y2="67"></line><text fill="#6bffb3" font-size="11" x="245" y="100"> Spoke 1 </text><line opacity="0.8" stroke="#6bffb3" stroke-width="2" x1="257" x2="350" y1="179" y2="60"></line><text fill="#6bffb3" font-size="11" x="310" y="110"> Spoke 2 </text><line opacity="0.6" stroke="#6bffb3" stroke-width="2" x1="285" x2="405" y1="201" y2="140"></line><line stroke="#b3d4ff" stroke-width="2" x1="225" x2="280" y1="285" y2="383"></line><line opacity="0.8" stroke="#b3d4ff" stroke-width="2" x1="257" x2="350" y1="271" y2="390"></line><text fill="#b3b3ff" font-size="12" text-anchor="middle" x="225" y="420"> Each spoke crosses 3 others between hub and rim </text><g><circle cx="20" cy="440" fill="#ffe0b2" r="4"></circle><text fill="#ffe0b2" font-size="11" x="30" y="445"> Rim holes </text><circle cx="150" cy="440" fill="#ffb3b3" r="4"></circle><text fill="#ffb3b3" font-size="11" x="160" y="445"> Hub holes </text><line stroke="#6bffb3" stroke-width="2" x1="280" x2="310" y1="438" y2="438"></line><text fill="#6bffb3" font-size="11" x="320" y="443"> Right spokes </text></g></svg></div><div class="diagram-label"> 3-cross lacing distributes tension evenly and provides optimal strength-to-weight ratio for most bicycle wheels. </div><h3> Wheel Assembly Steps </h3><ol><li><strong> Preparation: </strong> Assemble rim tape, ensuring all spoke holes are covered. Mount hub in wheel stand or jig. </li><li><strong> Insert first group of spokes (18 for 36-spoke wheel): </strong> Insert spokes through flange holes on one side, working around the hub. Do not tension yet. </li><li><strong> Thread nipples: </strong> Screw threaded nipples (the ferrules that hold spokes in the rim) onto spoke threaded ends. Turn 3-4 threads only initially. </li><li><strong> Cross spokes: </strong> For 3-cross, each spoke will cross 3 other spokes. Route spokes under/over as they radiate to the rim. </li><li><strong> Insert opposite spokes: </strong> Insert the remaining 18 spokes from the opposite flange side. Thread all nipples lightly. </li><li><strong> True laterally: </strong> Spin the wheel and watch the rim. Tighten spokes on the left side to pull the rim left; tighten right-side spokes to pull right. Adjust in small increments (1/4 turn) until the rim tracks straight. </li><li><strong> True radially: </strong> Check that the rim height is even around the circumference. Tighten all spokes equally to bring the rim closer to the hub if it appears too low; loosen all slightly if too high. Recheck lateral and radial truth. </li><li><strong> Final tensioning: </strong> Gradually increase tension evenly. Check tension with a spoke tension meter (or by feel — spokes should be quite tight, typically 1200-1500 N for road wheels). Ensure even tension; loose spokes cause wobbles and spoke breakage. </li><li><strong> Rest and recheck: </strong> Let the wheel rest 24 hours, then recheck truth and tension. New wheels often settle and require minor adjustments. </li></ol><h3> Rear Wheel Dishing </h3><p> A rear wheel with a cassette (multiple sprockets) must be <strong> dished </strong> — the rim is offset toward the non-drive (left) side to accommodate the right-side cassette. The hub axle remains centered in the dropouts, but the rim is pulled slightly to the left. </p><p> Dishing is achieved by using different spoke tensions: right-side spokes (drive side) are tighter, pulling the rim right. Left-side spokes are looser, allowing the rim to shift left. The net result is a wheel where the rim is off-center but the wheel remains true when centered in the frame dropouts. </p><div class="warning"><strong> Spoke tension is critical: </strong> Under-tensioned spokes lead to wheel collapse, spoke breakage, and poor braking performance. Over-tensioned spokes risk rim cracking and spoke snapping during impacts. Aim for even, moderate-to-high tension on all spokes (similar tension all around). </div></section><section class="section" id="drivetrain"><h2> 5. Drivetrain Systems </h2><p> The drivetrain converts pedal rotation into wheel rotation. Single-speed designs offer simplicity and reliability; multi-speed systems add versatility at the cost of complexity. </p><h3> Chain </h3><p> Bicycle chains are roller chains identical to industrial chain (both use 1/2" pitch — 12.7 mm between roller centers). Chains consist of alternating outer plates, inner plates, and hardened steel rollers. </p><h4> Chain Sizing </h4><p> Chain width varies: standard bicycle chains are 3/32" wide (2.4 mm). Wider chains (1/8") on single-speed bikes are stronger and more forgiving of misalignment. </p><p><strong> Chain length calculation: </strong> Wrap a new chain around the largest chainring and largest rear cog without pedaling. The chain should be snug but not tight. Add 2 links to allow for small adjustments. Cut the chain using a chain breaker tool, which pushes out a pin, allowing removal of a link. </p><h4> Chain Repair </h4><p> Master links (also called quick links) allow tool-free chain joining and removal. Modern chains often come with reusable master links. A broken chain can be repaired with a new master link without special tools. </p><div class="spec-box"><strong> Chain repair steps: </strong><ol><li> Remove the broken section with a chain breaker tool or by manually breaking at a weak point. </li><li> Install a new master link: outer plate (with teeth), two rollers, and inner plate. </li><li> Connect the master link between chain ends, ensuring the outer plate faces the direction of chain travel (teeth point forward). </li><li> Check for smooth rotation without binding. </li></ol></div><h3> Chainring & Cog </h3><p> The chainring is a large sprocket (30-50+ teeth) mounted on the right crank. It engages the chain with teeth that lock into the chain rollers. The rear cog (or cogs in a cassette) is mounted on the rear hub's freewheel. </p><h4> Tooth Engagement </h4><p> Teeth must be sharp and evenly spaced. Worn chainrings and cogs have rounded tooth profiles that cause chain slipping and accelerate wear. Replacement is typically cheaper than attempting to restore worn teeth. </p><h3> Freewheel & Cassette </h3><p> A <strong> freewheel </strong> is a assembly containing one or more cogs and a ratchet mechanism. The ratchet allows the wheel to spin freely (coasting) when the pedals are stationary. When the rider pedals forward, the ratchet engages, locking the cogs to the hub and transmitting power to the wheel. </p><p><strong> Single-speed configuration: </strong> One freewheel with a single cog. Simplest, most durable design. Ideal for flat terrain or consistent grade. </p><p><strong> Multi-speed cassette: </strong> Multiple cogs (5-11) of increasing size (fewer teeth to more teeth). Shifted using a derailleur. More complex but adaptable to varying terrain. </p><h3> Single-Speed vs. Multi-Speed </h3><div class="content-grid"><div><h4> Single-Speed Advantages </h4><ul><li> No derailleur or shifter complexity </li><li> Minimal maintenance </li><li> Direct power transfer; no efficiency loss to derailleurs </li><li> Lower cost </li><li> Lighter weight </li><li> Ideal for flat terrain or consistent climbing </li></ul></div><div><h4> Multi-Speed Advantages </h4><ul><li> Adaptable gear ratios for varied terrain </li><li> Rider can maintain optimal pedal cadence across speeds </li><li> Useful for touring with cargo </li><li> More versatile for rider fitness levels </li></ul></div></div><h3> Gear Ratio & Speed Calculation </h3><div class="formula"> Gear Inches = (Chainring Teeth ÷ Cog Teeth) × Wheel Diameter (inches) Speed (mph) = Pedal Cadence (RPM) × Gear Inches ÷ 336 </div><h4> Example Calculation </h4><p> A cyclist with a 48-tooth chainring, 16-tooth cog, and 27-inch wheel diameter: </p><div class="spec-box"> Gear Inches = (48 ÷ 16) × 27 = 3.0 × 27 = 81 inches At 90 RPM pedal cadence: Speed = (90 × 81) ÷ 336 = 21.7 mph </div><h3> Optimal Cadence </h3><p> Most cyclists are most efficient at 80-100 RPM pedal cadence. At this cadence, the human leg muscles operate at near-optimal mechanical advantage. Cadences below 60 RPM require excessive force; cadences above 120 RPM waste energy on rapid leg movements without increasing speed proportionally. </p><p> Single-speed bicycles are typically sized to give comfortable cadence at common riding speeds (15-20 mph for casual riding, 20-25 mph for racing). Gear ratios of 60-100 gear inches suit most riders and terrain. </p></section><section class="section" id="tires-tubes"><h2> 6. Tire & Tube </h2><p> Tires are the critical interface between bicycle and ground. Proper tire pressure, maintenance, and repair ensure reliability and efficiency. </p><h3> Pneumatic Tires </h3><p> Standard bicycle tires consist of a rubber casing (outer layer) bonded to a fabric carcass (structural layer), with an inner tube inside. The tube holds air under pressure (30-100 PSI depending on tire and rider weight), providing cushioning and rolling resistance reduction. </p><h4> Tire Components </h4><ul><li><strong> Tread: </strong> Outer rubber surface that contacts the ground. Tread patterns affect traction in wet conditions; smooth slicks have lower rolling resistance. </li><li><strong> Sidewall: </strong> Thinner rubber layer on the sides. Protects the carcass from cuts. </li><li><strong> Carcass: </strong> Fabric layers (cotton, nylon, or aramid) that provide structure and load-bearing capacity. Higher thread counts (TPI — threads per inch) offer better ride quality and durability. </li><li><strong> Bead: </strong> Wire or fiber rim lock edge that holds the tire to the rim. Wire beads are cheaper and heavier; folding (fiber) beads are lighter and packable. </li></ul><h3> Tube Repair <h4> Locating Punctures </h4><ul><li><strong> Visual inspection: </strong> Look for thorns, glass, or sharp objects embedded in the tread or sidewall. </li><li><strong> Water test: </strong> Inflate the tube and submerge in water. Bubbles reveal the leak location. </li><li><strong> Listening: </strong> Inflate the tube and listen for a faint hiss near the suspected area. </li></ul><h4> Patch Repair Steps </h4><ol><li><strong> Prepare the area: </strong> Mark the hole and dry the tube completely. Use sandpaper or a metal scraper to roughen the area around the hole (about 1" diameter). This allows the adhesive to bond properly. </li><li><strong> Apply cement: </strong> Spread a thin, even layer of vulcanizing cement (provided in patch kits) over the roughened area. Follow kit instructions for drying time (typically 3-5 minutes). The cement should be tacky but not wet. </li><li><strong> Apply patch: </strong> Press the patch firmly onto the cemented area. Use sustained pressure for 1-2 minutes to ensure strong adhesion. Do not move the patch once contact is made. </li><li><strong> Wait and test: </strong> Allow 5-10 minutes before inflating. Test the repair by spraying soapy water on the patch; no bubbles indicate a good seal. </li></ol><h3> Solid Tires </h3><p> Solid tires eliminate flats but offer a harsher ride and higher rolling resistance. DIY solid tires can be cut from old automobile tire carcasses. </p><h4> Making Solid Tires </h4><ul><li> Source an old car tire (25-30" diameter, 7-8" wide). </li><li> Cut the tire sidewalls and tread to leave a rubber ring 2" wide that matches the wheel rim diameter. </li><li> Mount the ring on the rim, seating it in the rim well (no tube necessary). </li><li> Test for wobbles and adjust diameter as needed. </li></ul><p> Solid tires are suitable for cargo bikes, slow urban riding, or areas with abundant thorns. They reduce efficiency due to higher rolling resistance (5-10% more energy required compared to pneumatic tires). </p><h3> Rim Tape </h3><p> Rim tape covers spoke ends and holes in the rim, protecting the inner tube from punctures. Adhesive (clincher) tape is easiest to install but can shift under load. Tubular rim tape (cloth-based) is traditional and more robust. </p><div class="tip"><strong> Proper rim tape installation: </strong> Center the tape on the rim to ensure even coverage of all spoke holes. Press firmly and smooth out air bubbles. The tape should extend 5-10 mm onto the tire bead area, not into the rim well where tube beads seat. </div></h3></section><section class="section" id="cargo-bikes"><h2> 7. Cargo Bikes & Trailers </h2><p> Bicycles can carry substantial payload. Purpose-designed cargo bikes and trailers extend capacity beyond standard frames. </p><h3> Longtail Bicycles </h3><p> A longtail frame extends the rear triangle, providing a long cargo platform or rack behind the seat. The extended wheelbase (1200+ mm, compared to 950 mm standard) improves stability under load. </p><h4> Longtail Design Features </h4><ul><li><strong> Extended chainstays: </strong> Rear axle is 200-400 mm farther back than standard bicycles. </li><li><strong> Cargo platform: </strong> Flat metal shelf welded to the extended chainstays, with sides and straps for securing cargo. </li><li><strong> Reinforced frame: </strong> Heavier tubing in chainstays and seatstays to handle 100-200 kg payload (rider + cargo). </li><li><strong> Capacity: </strong> 50-200 kg additional payload, depending on frame strength and rider weight. Total system weight (bike + rider + cargo) can reach 250+ kg. </li></ul><h3> Front-Loader (Bakfiets) </h3><p> A Dutch-style cargo bike with a large box mounted between the rider and front wheel. The rider sits high, with cargo low and forward, providing excellent weight distribution and low center of gravity. </p><h4> Bakfiets Features </h4><ul><li><strong> Cargo box: </strong> Typically 0.5-1.0 m³ capacity, capable of carrying 50-100+ kg. </li><li><strong> Short wheelbase front section: </strong> Front wheel is positioned close to the box for maneuverability. </li><li><strong> Extended rear: </strong> Long chainstays provide stability and carrying area. </li><li><strong> Steering geometry: </strong> Shallow head angle (65-70°) for stable, predictable handling. </li><li><strong> Seat height: </strong> Rider sits above the cargo, improving visibility and handling. </li></ul><h3> Bicycle Trailers </h3><p> Trailers decouple cargo from the bicycle, allowing use of a standard frame. Two-wheel and single-wheel designs exist. </p><h4> Two-Wheel Trailers </h4><ul><li><strong> BOB-style (one wheel): </strong> Single wheel carrier with a hitch attachment to the seat post or rear rack. Low cargo area, easy to maneuver. Capacity: 25-50 kg. </li><li><strong> Two-wheel flatbed: </strong> Axle between two wheels, platform for cargo. More stable when heavily loaded. Capacity: 50-150 kg. </li><li><strong> Hitch design: </strong> Pivoting connection allows the trailer to articulate independently, improving handling and allowing tighter turns. </li></ul><h4> Single-Wheel Trailers </h4><p> Compact single-wheel trailers mount to the seat post or rear rack. Less stable than two-wheel designs but easier to stow when not in use. Suitable for light cargo (10-25 kg). </p><h3> Panniers & Racks </h3><p> Panniers (fabric bags) mount on a frame-mounted rack, hanging on either side of the rear wheel. Excellent for weight distribution and accessibility. </p><h4> Pannier Advantages </h4><ul><li> Weight distributed low and behind the rider, improving handling. </li><li> Easy on/off access to cargo. </li><li> Wide range of sizes and styles available. </li><li> Capacity: 20-40 kg total (10-20 kg per side). </li></ul><h4> Rack Mounting </h4><p> Racks mount to the frame via stays welded or bolted to the chainstays and seatstays. The rack should be sturdy (tubes at least 10 mm diameter for carrying 20+ kg). Top surface should be slightly curved to prevent cargo from shifting. </p></section><section class="section" id="bike-powered"><h2> 8. Bike-Powered Machines </h2><p> A bicycle's pedal-driven drivetrain can power external machines through belt or gear drives. Human power output ranges from 50 watts (casual pedaling) to 500+ watts (intense effort) for sustained periods. </p><h3> Human Power Output </h3><div class="spec-box"><strong> Typical sustainable power outputs (sustained for 1+ hours): </strong><ul><li><strong> Casual cycling: </strong> 50-100 watts </li><li><strong> Moderate effort: </strong> 100-200 watts </li><li><strong> Racing pace: </strong> 250-400 watts </li><li><strong> Professional cyclists: </strong> 400-500+ watts (sprinting can reach 1500+ watts for 5-10 seconds) </li></ul></div><h3> Grain Mill </h3><p> A pedal-powered grain mill grinds grains (wheat, corn, oats) into flour. The rear wheel or pedal crank drives a belt connected to a rotating millstone. </p><h4> Grain Mill Design </h4><ul><li><strong> Drive source: </strong> Rear wheel or pedal crank rotation, typically 50-150 RPM. </li><li><strong> Gear reduction: </strong> Belt and pulley or gear box increases torque for the millstone. A 1:3 or 1:4 ratio increases RPM from the rear wheel (200 RPM) to millstone (600-800 RPM) or reduces pedal RPM (90 RPM) to millstone (180-270 RPM). </li><li><strong> Millstone: </strong> Two round stones (1-2 feet diameter) with grooved surfaces. Upper stone rotates; lower stone is stationary. Grain fed between stones is crushed and ground. </li><li><strong> Power requirement: </strong> 50-150 watts sustained (light load) to 300+ watts (heavy load) depending on grain type and fineness desired. </li></ul><h3> Water Pump </h3><p> A pedal-powered pump lifts water from a well or other source. The crankset drives a piston pump or rotary pump mechanism. </p><h4> Water Pump Systems </h4><ul><li><strong> Piston pump: </strong> Crank rotation moves a piston back and forth in a cylinder. Check valves allow one-way water flow. Capable of pumping 5-30 liters per minute depending on piston size and pedal cadence. </li><li><strong> Rotary pump: </strong> Crankset drives a rotating gear or impeller within a fixed housing. Continuous-flow design, more efficient at high flow rates. </li><li><strong> Lift height: </strong> Limited by pump design and human power. 10-meter lift (head) is achievable with sustained effort; 30+ meter lifts require very high force. </li><li><strong> Coupling mechanism: </strong> Crank arms connect directly to pump piston rod or via a lever linkage. </li></ul><h3> Generator </h3><p> A rear-wheel-mounted alternator converts pedal rotation into electrical power. Standard automotive alternators (12V or higher) generate 50-150 watts at moderate pedaling intensity. </p><h4> Generator Design </h4><ul><li><strong> Alternator: </strong> 12V or 24V automotive alternator coupled to the rear wheel via a belt or direct contact roller. </li><li><strong> Output voltage regulation: </strong> Onboard regulator maintains constant voltage as pedal speed varies. Output is 12-14.5V DC (12V system). </li><li><strong> Battery charging: </strong> Generated power charges a battery bank (12V, 100+ Ah) for lights, radio, or devices. </li><li><strong> Power output: </strong> 50-100 watts sustained; 150-200 watts peak (difficult effort). Sufficient to charge phones, power LED lighting, or run small electronic loads. </li><li><strong> Mechanical coupling: </strong> Friction roller (spring-loaded against the tire) or belt drive. Roller is simpler but creates slight rolling resistance when not generating. </li></ul><h3> Washing Machine </h3><p> A pedal-powered tub agitator washes clothes. Crank rotation drives a lever or directly drives an agitator blade inside a wash tub. </p><h4> Washing Machine Design </h4><ul><li><strong> Tub: </strong> Wooden or plastic barrel (20-50 liters capacity) with drain hole near the bottom. </li><li><strong> Agitator: </strong> Blade or paddle that oscillates or rotates to move clothes and detergent through water. </li><li><strong> Drive mechanism: </strong> Crank arm connected to agitator via a linkage (converts circular crank motion to oscillating agitator motion) or direct gear drive. </li><li><strong> Pedaling: </strong> 30-60 RPM pedal cadence for 2-5 minutes per load. Low intensity, suitable for children and elderly users. </li></ul><h3> Blower / Air Supply </h3><p> A pedal-powered blower provides air for a forge or furnace. The rear wheel drives a centrifugal or piston-type blower. </p><h4> Blower Design </h4><ul><li><strong> Centrifugal blower: </strong> Fan impeller spins inside a housing. Higher RPM (1000+) produces more air. Lighter pedal effort than piston designs. </li><li><strong> Piston blower: </strong> Reciprocating piston compresses air in a cylinder. Provides steady air pressure suitable for forge operation. </li><li><strong> Power requirement: </strong> 100-200 watts for moderate air volume and pressure. </li><li><strong> Coupling: </strong> Belt drive from rear wheel (1:3 to 1:10 gear ratio) to blower input shaft. </li></ul><h3> Lathe </h3><p> A pedal-powered lathe spins wood or metal for turning operations. The rear wheel or pedal crank drives the spindle. </p><h4> Lathe Design </h4><ul><li><strong> Spindle: </strong> Rotating shaft that holds the workpiece (wood, metal bar). Typical spindle speed: 200-500 RPM for wood turning, 50-200 RPM for metal work. </li><li><strong> Pedal input: </strong> Rear wheel at 200+ RPM requires significant gear reduction (1:2 to 1:5) to achieve lathe spindle speeds. </li><li><strong> Flywheel: </strong> Heavy wheel on the spindle or pedal crank stores rotational energy, smoothing pedal effort and reducing load variation. </li><li><strong> Tailstock & headstock: </strong> Standard lathe design with centers for mounting workpieces. Hand tools (chisels, parting tools) perform cutting. </li><li><strong> Power demand: </strong> 50-200 watts depending on workpiece material and cut depth. Metal turning requires more force than wood. </li></ul></section><section class="section" id="maintenance"><h2> 9. Maintenance Schedule </h2><p> Regular maintenance extends bicycle lifespan and ensures safe, efficient operation. A simple maintenance schedule prevents costly repairs and downtime. </p><h3> Daily Maintenance </h3><ul><li><strong> Tire pressure check: </strong> Verify tire pressure is within the recommended range (printed on the tire sidewall). Underinflated tires waste energy and increase puncture risk; overinflated tires reduce grip and ride comfort. </li><li><strong> Chain lubrication: </strong> Apply a thin layer of chain lube to the rollers and inner plates. Wipe excess to prevent dirt accumulation. A well-lubricated chain reduces friction by 5-10% and extends drivetrain life. </li><li><strong> Visual inspection: </strong> Look for visible damage, loose parts, or unusual noise sources. </li></ul><h3> Weekly Maintenance </h3><ul><li><strong> Brake check: </strong> Squeeze brake levers to verify braking force. Rim brakes should feel responsive; coaster brakes engage smoothly without slipping. Adjust brake cable tension or pad position if needed. </li><li><strong> Wheel true check: </strong> Spin wheels and watch for lateral (side-to-side) wobble. Minor wobbles (2-3 mm) can be corrected with spoke adjustments. Major wobbles indicate bent rims or loose spokes. </li><li><strong> Spoke tension: </strong> Tap spokes with a tool; pitch should be similar across the wheel. Loose spokes (flat sound) indicate loose nipples; tighten gradually and evenly. </li></ul><h3> Monthly Maintenance </h3><ul><li><strong> Bearing adjustment: </strong> Test for play at the front hub, rear hub, and headset. Grasp the wheel rim and try to move it side-to-side. No movement indicates tight (too much friction); slight movement (1-2 mm) is correct. Loosen the axle nuts on the opposite side if play exists; tighten nuts on the loaded side to remove play. </li><li><strong> Bottom bracket: </strong> Rotate pedals slowly through a full revolution. Smooth rotation with no grinding indicates proper adjustment. Grinding sounds indicate loose bearings (loosen bearing cups slightly) or dry bearings (add grease). </li><li><strong> Headset: </strong> Hold the frame with one hand and fork with the other. Try to move the fork up and down. No play should be detected. Grasp the fork and rotate it; it should spin smoothly without binding. </li><li><strong> Spoke tension measurement: </strong> Use a spoke tension meter (if available) or compare tension by plucking spokes. Tension should be even across all spokes (±10% variation). </li></ul><h3> Annual Full Overhaul </h3><p> Once per year (or every 2000-3000 km), perform a complete disassembly and inspection: </p><ol><li><strong> Remove wheels: </strong> Disassemble quick-releases or axle nuts. Inspect rims for cracks and dents. Check hubs and axles for rust. </li><li><strong> Disassemble bottom bracket: </strong> Remove crank arms (crank bolt in center of each arm). Unbolt the bottom bracket cup on the drive side; inspect bearings and axle for wear and rust. Clean, inspect, and repack with waterproof grease if condition is good; replace if bearings are damaged. </li><li><strong> Disassemble headset: </strong> Loosen stem clamp and remove handlebars and stem. Remove headset bearing caps. Inspect and repack bearings as with bottom bracket. </li><li><strong> Disassemble hubs: </strong> Remove axle nuts and quick-release mechanisms. Pry out bearing cups and cones. Inspect bearings for rust and damage. Clean and repack with grease. </li><li><strong> Inspect frame: </strong> Clean frame and inspect for cracks, dents, or paint damage. Touch up small paint chips to prevent rust. </li><li><strong> Reassemble: </strong> Reverse the disassembly process. Apply thin coat of grease to all bearing surfaces, threads, and interfaces to prevent corrosion. </li></ol><h3> Storage & Protection </h3><ul><li><strong> Indoor storage: </strong> Store bicycles indoors away from moisture to prevent rust. A simple wall mount or stand keeps tires off the ground and wheels true. </li><li><strong> Tire pressure: </strong> Inflate tires to full pressure before storing for extended periods. Partially deflated tires lose air slowly over weeks, allowing pinch flats when resumed riding. </li><li><strong> Lubrication: </strong> Apply a thin coat of light oil to the chain and unpainted steel surfaces before extended storage (winter, etc.) to prevent oxidation. </li></ul></section><section class="section" id="salvaging"><h2> 10. Salvaging & Repurposing Bicycle Parts </h2><p> Used bicycles contain valuable components suitable for rebuilding, repair, or adaptation to other uses. Salvage operations require basic disassembly skills and cleaning. </p><h3> Sourcing Used Bicycles </h3><ul><li><strong> Abandoned bicycles: </strong> Parks, street curbs, and parking areas often have abandoned bikes. Local police departments or city agencies may release unclaimed bicycles for community use. </li><li><strong> Junk yards: </strong> Metal recyclers and scrap yards often have piles of old bicycles. Purchasing entire bikes by weight can be cheaper than buying individual parts. </li><li><strong> Estate sales & auctions: </strong> Deceased persons' bicycles are often sold in bulk at estate sales or auctions. Prices may be low due to perceived value, even if the bicycles are repairable. </li><li><strong> Online marketplaces: </strong> Craigslist, OfferUp, and similar platforms list free or cheap used bicycles. Buyers often prefer to simply dispose of bicycles rather than sell for low prices. </li><li><strong> Old exercise equipment: </strong> Stationary exercise bikes contain useful components (pedals, cranks, chains) that adapt to tricycles or stationary power generators. </li></ul><h3> Valuable Salvageable Parts </h3><h4> Chains </h4><p> Chains from bicycles are identical to industrial roller chain and can be repurposed for other machines. A worn 1/2" pitch bicycle chain can be retrofitted to a homemade grain mill, water pump, or loom. Clean thoroughly and relubricate before use. Chains can also be salvaged for links as replacement material if a link is broken in a different chain application. </p><h4> Wheels </h4><p> Complete wheels (rim, spokes, hub) can be salvaged and reused on other frames. Rims can be repurposed as wheel-rims for hand-drawn carts, as hoops for other structures, or as pulleys for belt drives. Spokes can be bent into shapes for various projects. </p><h4> Tubes & Tires </h4><p> Inner tubes are valuable for: </p><ul><li> Slingshot ammunition (cut strips of rubber) </li><li> Tourniquet material for first aid or veterinary use </li><li> Elastic straps for cargo securing </li><li> Repair patches (used tubes can be cut to make custom patch material) </li><li> Seals for homemade pumps or hydraulic applications </li></ul><p> Tires provide rubber material for: </p><ul><li> Solid bicycle tires (cut to size and mounted on rims) </li><li> Gaskets and seals in homemade machinery </li><li> Shock absorbers in trailers or carts </li><li> Playground surfacing or matting </li></ul><h4> Spokes as Wire Stock </h4><p> Bicycle spokes are high-strength steel wire (2.0-2.3 mm diameter) suitable for: </p><ul><li> Reinforcement in concrete or clay structures </li><li> Tension members in fabric structures </li><li> Wires for electrical applications (low current) </li><li> Suspension system components (springs, cables) </li><li> Brackets and structural connectors (bent to shape) </li></ul><h4> Pedals & Cranks </h4><p> Pedals are bearing-equipped rotating assemblies useful for: </p><ul><li> Replacement pedals on repaired bicycles </li><li> Adaptation to stationary grinders or saws </li><li> Conversion to hand cranks (detach pedal arms, refit with a straight handle) </li></ul><p> Crank arms are steel levers useful for: </p><ul><li> Bent into structural components </li><li> Reforged or brazed for larger implements </li><li> Lever handles for jacks, presses, or cranking mechanisms </li></ul><h4> Handlebars & Stems </h4><p> Handlebars are steel tubes (25-32 mm diameter) useful for: </p><ul><li> Structural components in carts or trailers </li><li> Tubing stock for home metalworking projects </li><li> Handles for large tools or implements </li></ul><h4> Bottom Bracket & Headset </h4><p> These bearing assemblies can be: </p><ul><li> Salvaged and inspected for bearing condition </li><li> Adapted as input bearings for homemade machinery (mills, pumps) </li><li> Reused in frame rebuilds </li></ul><h3> Disassembly & Cleaning </h3><h4> Tools Required </h4><ul><li> Allen wrenches (4-6 mm) </li><li> Adjustable wrench or open-end wrench set </li><li> Screwdriver (flathead and Phillips) </li><li> Chain breaker tool (for chain removal) </li><li> Spoke wrench (optional; for hub and spoke work) </li></ul><h4> Disassembly Steps </h4><ol><li><strong> Remove wheels: </strong> Quick-release levers or axle bolts hold wheels. Remove both wheels and set aside. </li><li><strong> Remove drivetrain: </strong> Chain removal requires a chain breaker tool to punch out a pin, allowing the chain to separate. Crankset removal requires a crank extractor tool (specialized but inexpensive). Cassette removal requires a cassette lockring tool. Chainring is usually bolted to the crank. </li><li><strong> Remove handlebars & stem: </strong> Stem clamp bolts hold the stem to the steerer tube. Handlebar clamp bolts hold the bar to the stem. </li><li><strong> Separate frame sections: </strong> Brazed or welded joints cannot be separated without cutting or extensive heat application. Bolted components (like detachable dropouts or seat posts) can be removed with wrenches. </li><li><strong> Remove hubs from wheels: </strong> Axle bolts or quick-release levers hold the hub in the wheel rim. Remove, then press the axle out of the hub flange using a bearing press or tap out with a soft-faced mallet. </li></ol><h4> Cleaning </h4><p> Submerge parts in degreaser (white spirit, kerosene, or commercial degreaser) to remove dirt and old grease. Scrub with a brush to remove stubborn residue. Rinse with water and dry thoroughly with a cloth or compressed air. Store in a dry location to prevent rust. </p><h3> Reassembly & Adaptation </h3><p> Salvaged parts can be integrated into new builds: </p><ul><li><strong> Frame rebuilds: </strong> Salvaged wheels, drivetrain, and steering components fit new frames built from tube stock. </li><li><strong> Trike conversion: </strong> A salvaged bicycle wheelset can be adapted into a tricycle by building a wider rear axle and frame extension. </li><li><strong> Cargo bikes: </strong> Salvaged wheels and drivetrains fit extended frames for cargo carrying. </li><li><strong> Stationary equipment: </strong> Pedal-powered mills, pumps, and generators use salvaged wheels and cranksets as power inputs. </li></ul></section><div class="related-guides"><h3> Related Guides in Offline Compendium </h3><p> Expand your knowledge with these complementary guides: </p><ul style='list-style: none; margin-left: 0;'><li><a href="transportation.html"> Transportation Systems </a> — Wheeled vehicles, human-powered transport, and cargo solutions </li><li><a href="machine-tools.html"> Machine Tools & Workshop Equipment </a> — Lathes, mills, grinders, and hand tools for fabrication </li><li><a href="energy-systems.html"> Energy Systems & Power Generation </a> — Human-powered generators, solar, and alternative energy </li><li><a href="metalworking.html"> Metalworking & Fabrication </a> — Welding, brazing, forging, and metal joining techniques </li><li><a href="engineering-repair.html"> Engineering & Repair Fundamentals </a> — Design principles, diagnostics, and maintenance best practices </li></ul></div><div class="common-mistakes"><h3> Common Mistakes </h3><ul><li> Add specific common mistakes here based on the guide content </li></ul></div><div class="notes-section"><div class="notes-header"><span> My Notes </span><span class="notes-toggle"> ▼ </span></div><div class="notes-content"><textarea class="notes-textarea" id="guide-notes-text" placeholder='Add your personal notes here.
