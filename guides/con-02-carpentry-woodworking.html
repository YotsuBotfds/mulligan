Understanding both commercially available and improvised tools ensures you can work in any scenario.</p><h3>Essential Tools & Alternatives:</h3><ul><li><strong>Saw:</strong> Commercial hand saw (critical) or improvised bone/stone saw. Bone saws effective on softwood but require 20% more effort.</li><li><strong>Axe:</strong> Hafted stone head or bone wedge. Requires well-hardened handle. Modern axes superior for speed, but stone tools sufficient.</li><li><strong>Chisel:</strong> Sharpened bone, stone edge, or hardened wood wedge. Stone chisels chip easily; bone chisels superior.</li><li><strong>Hammer:</strong> Rock with flat face, wood mallet, or bone hammer. Effectiveness depends on striking surface density.</li><li><strong>Plane:</strong> Sharpened bone blade set in wooden frame. Slower than metal planes but produces smooth surfaces.</li><li><strong>Clamps:</strong> Rope tension clamps or wooden screw clamps. Rope clamps sufficient for most applications.</li></ul><h3>Making a Stone Adze (Multi-Purpose Carving Tool):</h3><ol><li>Select dense stone (flint, basalt) 8-10cm diameter</li><li>Strike to create sharp edge perpendicular to long axis</li><li>Create hafting notch by careful edge chipping</li><li>Lash to hardwood handle with cordage</li><li>Test edge sharpness before heavy use</li><li>Resharpen by careful stone-on-stone edge work</li></ol><div class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Bone tools consistently outperform stone for precision work. If you have access to large animal bones, dedicate time to making bone tools—they pay dividends over months of construction work.</div></section><section id="wood-selection"><h2>Wood Selection & Processing</h2><p>Wood quality determines structural integrity and construction ease. Understanding wood properties and processing methods is fundamental to carpentry success.</p><h3>Wood Selection by Application:</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Wood Type</th><th scope="row">Density</th><th scope="row">Best Use</th><th scope="row">Properties</th></tr><tr><td>Oak</td><td>Very High</td><td>Structural, Posts</td><td>Strong, rot-resistant, difficult to cut</td></tr><tr><td>Maple</td><td>Very High</td><td>Floors, Tools</td><td>Hard, dense, excellent wear</td></tr><tr><td>Ash</td><td>High</td><td>Tool Handles</td><td>Flexible, shock-absorbing</td></tr><tr><td>Pine</td><td>Low</td><td>General Building</td><td>Easy to cut, lightweight, needs drying</td></tr><tr><td>Birch</td><td>High</td><td>Bentwork, Furniture</td><td>Flexible when steamed, rot-prone</td></tr><tr><td>Spruce</td><td>Low</td><td>Framing</td><td>Straight grain, lightweight, weak in tension</td></tr></table><h3>Lumber Processing:</h3><p><strong>Tree felling:</strong> Cut at base at 45-degree angle (easier than horizontal cut). Let tree drop naturally; do not try to control fall without experience. Allow felled log 2-4 weeks for bark to loosen.</p><p><strong>Bark removal:</strong> Use wooden or bone wedge to split bark from log, or soak in water 1-2 weeks to allow easy removal. Begin at butt end where bark naturally separates.</p><p><strong>Log splitting:</strong> Use wedges and maul or axe. Split along grain. Split diameter determines usable pieces: 50cm log yields 4-6 planks; 30cm log yields 2-3 planks. Waste is 15-20%.</p><p><strong>Sawing planks:</strong> Use pit saw (two-person) or hand saw. For critical structural members, saw along grain to create quartersawn planks (more stable, less warping). Standard sawing acceptable for general purposes.</p><p><strong>Drying:</strong> Stack cut lumber with 2cm spacing, protected from weather. Softwood dries in 6-12 weeks; hardwood requires 6-18 months. Air-dry lumber has 12-15% moisture content (acceptable for structures).</p><div class="warning"><strong>Safety Warning:</strong> Green (wet) wood is 50% heavier than dry. Do not underestimate weight of freshly cut logs. Use proper technique and leverage; do not rely on strength alone.</div></section><section id="mortise-tenon"><h2>Mortise & Tenon Joinery</h2><p>Mortise and tenon joints are strongest traditional wood-to-wood connections. Widely used in furniture, doors, windows, and frames.</p><h3>Basic Mortise & Tenon Design:</h3><p><strong>Mortise:</strong> Rectangular hole in receiving wood. Standard dimensions: depth 2/3 of wood thickness; width 1/3 of wood width; length 2.5-3 times width.</p><p><strong>Tenon:</strong> Projecting piece from joining wood, fitting into mortise. Must be slightly smaller than mortise (0.5mm tolerance) for tight fit when glued.</p><h3>Cutting Mortise by Hand:</h3><ol><li>Mark mortise layout on wood using knife—cuts fibers cleanly</li><li>Create small pilot hole at mortise center using bone drill or stone chisel</li><li>Use sharp chisel to remove wood in layers (5-10mm depth per pass)</li><li>Work from both sides toward center to avoid tearout at far side</li><li>Cut perpendicular to wood surface; do not angle chisel</li><li>Check fit with tenon test piece; adjust as needed</li><li>Final fit should require light hammer taps to seat fully</li></ol><h3>Cutting Tenon by Hand:</h3><ol><li>Mark tenon profile on four sides using knife and square</li><li>Use saw to cut long-grain sides (create vertical walls of tenon)</li><li>Use chisel to shape cross-grain shoulders where tenon meets body wood</li><li>Test fit in mortise regularly; remove small amounts of material</li><li>Final dimension: tenon fully enters mortise with light resistance</li></ol><h3>Layout Precision:</h3><p>Mortise and tenon success requires accurate layout. Use sharpened bone or hardwood marking gauge. Mark mortise and tenon dimensions on all pieces before cutting any. Double-check all dimensions before committing cuts.</p><div class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Create a test joint first using scrap wood identical to finished piece. This reveals any technique issues and tool problems before irreplaceable material is ruined.</div></section><section id="dovetail"><h2>Dovetail Joints</h2><p>Dovetail joints provide superior strength and mechanical interlocking. Traditionally used in drawers and boxes where pulling stress is high.</p><h3>Dovetail Types:</h3><p><strong>Through dovetails:</strong> Tails (protruding pieces) visible on both sides. Strongest but requires precise fit. Typical angle: 8-degree slope (1:6 ratio in softwood, 1:8 in hardwood).</p><p><strong>Half-blind dovetails:</strong> Tails hidden from one side. Used where appearance matters (drawer fronts). Requires careful layout.</p><p><strong>Box joints:</strong> Simplified version using rectangular protrusions instead of angled. Faster to cut, adequate strength for light boxes.</p><h3>Layout for Through Dovetails:</h3><ol><li>Measure and mark baselines on all pieces (typically 2-3mm in from edge)</li><li>Divide width into equal sections (typical: 3-5 tail sections per side)</li><li>Draw angled lines at 8-degree slope from baselines to represent tails</li><li>Mark pin areas (receiving wood) by transferring tail pattern</li><li>Label all pieces and mark grain direction clearly</li></ol><h3>Cutting Through Dovetails:</h3><ol><li>Clamp wood vertically in vise with grain vertical</li><li>Use hand saw to cut tail edges at 8-degree angle</li><li>Cut with saw leading on waste side—do not touch scribed line</li><li>Chop out waste between tails using sharp chisel</li><li>Test fit with pin board (receiving board)</li><li>Mark pin positions by placing tail board on top and scribing with knife</li><li>Cut pins identically to tails</li><li>Final assembly: tap together with mallet; glue if permanent</li></ol><h3>Dovetail Spacing:</h3><p>Minimum tail width: 1.5cm for softwood, 1cm for hardwood (avoids splits). Spacing affects appearance and strength: widely spaced tails (5-8cm) appear coarse but are strongest; closely spaced tails (1-2cm) appear refined but require precision.</p></section><section id="timber-framing"><h2>Timber Framing Techniques</h2><p>Timber framing creates strong structures using massive timber beams joined with traditional joinery. Foundational for buildings that last centuries.</p><h3>Structural Design Principles:</h3><ul><li><strong>Load paths:</strong> Design structures so loads travel directly through beams to ground. Avoid complex stress patterns.</li><li><strong>Beam sizing:</strong> Rule of thumb: depth in inches should equal span in feet divided by 20 (beam 20 feet span requires 12-inch depth minimum).</li><li><strong>Joint strength:</strong> Joints must be stronger than adjoining beams (typically 90% of beam strength).</li><li><strong>Redundancy:</strong> Design so single joint failure does not collapse structure.</li></ul><h3>Common Timber Frame Joints:</h3><p><strong>Post-to-beam:</strong> Mortise and tenon where beam sits in post mortise. Post absorbs bearing load directly. Requires 25% post diameter depth mortise.</p><p><strong>Beam-to-beam:</strong> Joinery where beams meet at angles. Commonly: half-lap joints, mortise-tenon combinations, or scarfs (overlapping angled joints).</p><p><strong>Connection hardware:</strong> Use wooden pegs (10-12mm diameter hardwood) to lock joints, preventing movement from wood shrinkage or seasonal expansion.</p><h3>Raising Timber Frame Structure:</h3><ol><li>Assemble frame on ground with all joints fitted dry</li><li>Test all connections; adjust before final assembly</li><li>Disassemble completely</li><li>Reassemble at height using gin pole (mechanical advantage lever) or block and tackle system</li><li>Insert pegs into holes during assembly to lock frame</li><li>Check for square using diagonal measurements</li><li>Brace frame temporarily until roof attaches</li></ol></section><section id="furniture"><h2>Furniture Construction</h2><p>Building sturdy furniture ensures comfort in survival situations. Functional designs are far superior to decorative styles in survival contexts.</p><h3>Essential Survival Furniture:</h3><h4>Sleeping Platform (Bed):</h4><p>Elevated 60cm off ground using timber frame and rope webbing or wooden slats. Dimensions: 2m long, 1.2m wide minimum. Frame uses 5cm diameter posts, 10cm cross members. Rope webbing (2cm natural fiber rope) stretched across frame at 15cm spacing provides flexible support. Alternative: split log slats laid 5cm apart.</p><h4>Storage Box:</h4><p>Constructed from planks joined with dovetails or mortise-tenon. Dimensions: 60cm x 40cm x 40cm. Hinged lid with stay bar prevents opening too far. Interior shelf divides space for organization. Bottom board sits on batten supports (prevents moisture absorption through ground contact).</p><h4>Table:</h4><p>Simple design: four square-section legs (6cm x 6cm), cross-braced at 40cm height for strength. Top made from wide planks (glued and doweled together, or mortised into legs). Height: 75-80cm. Bracing provides torsion strength.</p><h4>Chair:</h4><p>Practical design: vertical back support (1.2m), angled seat frame (15-degree slope back), four legs with cross-bracing. Seat surface made from rope webbing (comfortable and durable). Minimum height: 45cm seat to floor.</p><h3>Wood Movement Compensation:</h3><p>Wood shrinks and swells with moisture changes. Account for movement in wide boards: allow 5mm per 30cm width for seasonal movement. Use floating panels (not fully glued) and slots for screw holes (not centered in hole—allows movement).</p></section><section id="hand-tools"><h2>Making Hand Tools</h2><p>In extended survival situations, you must fabricate tools. Understanding tool principles allows improvisation from available materials.</p><h3>Making a Wooden Plane:</h3><ol><li>Select hardwood block (oak, maple) 25cm long, 8cm wide, 5cm tall</li><li>Cut blade slot perpendicular to length (40mm deep)</li><li>Create wedge to lock blade in place</li><li>Sharpen bone or stone blade to 25-30 degree angle</li><li>Flatten sole of plane to accept wood surfaces evenly</li><li>Test: plane should remove thin shavings (1mm or less) in one direction</li></ol><h3>Making a Saw from Bone:</h3><ol><li>Use large animal rib bone (60cm or longer)</li><li>Create triangular cross-section by splitting or grinding</li><li>Sharpen edge to 30-degree angle using fine stone</li><li>Create handle from antler or hardwood at one end</li><li>Cut teeth into edge using small chisel (2-3mm spacing)</li><li>Use with two-handed pulling motion; effective on softwood</li></ol><h3>Making Wooden Clamps:</h3><ol><li>Use hardwood block (10cm x 5cm x 2.5cm) as base</li><li>Drill hole through width for wooden screw (5cm diameter)</li><li>Create wooden screw by tapering hardwood dowel and cutting grooves (4-6 grooves)</li><li>Mount screw vertically; tighten by rotating screw through wood nut</li><li>Movable jaw allows variable clamping width</li><li>Sufficient for holding wood during joinery work</li></ol></section><section id="joinery-table"><h2>Joinery Selection Table</h2><table><tr><th scope="row">Joint Type</th><th scope="row">Strength</th><th scope="row">Difficulty</th><th scope="row">Best Uses</th><th scope="row">Speed</th></tr><tr><td>Butt Joint</td><td>Low</td><td>Very Easy</td><td>Temporary, Non-critical</td><td>Very Fast</td></tr><tr><td>Lap Joint</td><td>Medium</td><td>Easy</td><td>Framing, T-joints</td><td>Fast</td></tr><tr><td>Mortise & Tenon</td><td>Very High</td><td>Difficult</td><td>Structural, Furniture</td><td>Slow</td></tr><tr><td>Dovetail</td><td>Very High</td><td>Very Difficult</td><td>Drawers, Boxes</td><td>Very Slow</td></tr><tr><td>Scarf Joint</td><td>High</td><td>Difficult</td><td>Beam Extensions</td><td>Slow</td></tr><tr><td>Box Joint</td><td>High</td><td>Medium</td><td>Simple Boxes</td><td>Medium</td></tr></table></section><section id="common-mistakes"><h2>Common Mistakes & Solutions</h2><h3>Mistake 1: Insufficient Tool Sharpness</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Attempting woodworking with dull tools. Results: forced cuts, tool breakage, wood tearout, poor-fitting joints, extreme fatigue.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Dedicate 30% of woodworking time to tool maintenance. Sharpen chisels, saws, and planes weekly. Dull tools require 3-5x more effort than sharp ones.</p><h3>Mistake 2: Ignoring Grain Direction</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Planing or chiseling against grain direction. Results: deep tearout, rough surface, tool chattering, unsafe tool control.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Always identify grain direction (usually visible in wood end grain). Plane downslope of grain direction. Work from high grain to low grain.</p><h3>Mistake 3: Over-Tightening Joints</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Driving mortise-tenon joints too tightly during test-fit, jamming them. Results: unable to disassemble, wood splits during removal, joint damaged.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Test-fit joints without force. Mark fitting difficulty. Disassemble immediately. Do not fully tap joints until final assembly with glue.</p><h3>Mistake 4: Ignoring Wood Movement</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Building furniture with wood glued across grain or fully constrained. Wood shrinks seasonally, causing splits, warping, or failed joints.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Allow wood movement in wide boards (floating panels, slotted screw holes). Glue only in grain direction. Accept seasonal dimension changes as normal.</p></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="con-01-shelter-building.html">Shelter Building</a><a href="bone-tools.html">Bone Tool Making</a><a href="stone-tools.html">Stone Tool Making</a><a href="cra-01-forging-metalwork.html">Forging & Metalwork</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
