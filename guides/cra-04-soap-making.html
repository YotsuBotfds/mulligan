Traditional method: leaching water through wood ashes. Modern alternative: collecting lye from commercial drain cleaners (advanced).</p><h3>Traditional Wood Ash Lye:</h3><ol><li><strong>Collect ash:</strong> Hardwood ash preferred (pine/softwood ash has lower potency). Use ash from burned wood, not charcoal.</li><li><strong>Build leach barrel:</strong> Wooden barrel or clay pot with drainage hole near bottom. Alternative: bundle straw in bottom to act as filter.</li><li><strong>Fill with ash:</strong> Layer ash in barrel, filling to 3/4 capacity.</li><li><strong>Pour water:</strong> Add rain water or distilled water (no minerals) to ash. Add slowly to prevent air pockets. Water should rise 10-15cm above ash.</li><li><strong>Leach time:</strong> Allow 48 hours minimum (up to 1 week). Water percolates through ash, extracting lye compounds.</li><li><strong>Collect lye water:</strong> Carefully drain collected liquid into separate container. Color: golden/brown. Smell: distinctly basic (not pleasant).</li><li><strong>Test strength:</strong> Float raw egg in lye water. Correct strength: egg floats with 1cm above surface. Weak lye: egg sinks. Very strong: large area of egg above water.</li></ol><h3>Concentration (Making Lye Stronger):</h3><p>Boil collected lye water until concentration increases. Lye dissolves minerals from ash, making weak solution. Boiling off water concentrates lye (be careful: lye burns). Stop boiling when ash settles out; liquid is usable lye.</p><h3>Safety Consideration:</h3><p>Wood ash lye contains variable lye concentration (typically 2-5%) compared to pure sodium hydroxide (100%). Therefore, more wood ash lye water is required compared to commercial lye. Test batches guide proper quantities.</p></section><section id="saponification"><h2>Saponification Chemistry</h2><p>Saponification: chemical reaction where lye breaks fat molecules, creating soap (salt + glycerin). Temperature, timing, and proportions critical.</p><h3>Basic Reaction:</h3><p>Fat + Lye (alkali) = Soap (fatty acid salt) + Glycerin</p><h3>Key Variables:</h3><ul><li><strong>Oil type:</strong> Different fats require different lye amounts. Coconut oil requires more lye than olive oil.</li><li><strong>Water content:</strong> Too little: mixture too thick; too much: soap takes months to cure</li><li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Cold process (65-75°C): slow, gentle. Hot process (120°C+): fast, hot</li><li><strong>Stirring:</strong> Thorough mixing essential for uniform saponification. Lumpy soap results from incomplete mixing.</li><li><strong>Trace:</strong> Point when mixture reaches pudding-like consistency (lye fully reacted). Indicates saponification 80-90% complete.</li></ul><h3>Superfatting:</h3><p>Adding extra oil beyond lye requirement ensures some unreacted oil in final soap (creates milder, less drying soap). Typical: 5-10% superfatting (use 5-10% less lye than calculated).</p></section><section id="cold-process"><h2>Cold Process Soap Making</h2><h3>Process Overview:</h3><ol><li><strong>Prepare lye water:</strong> Mix lye with water (always add lye to water, never reverse). Temperature: cool to room temperature before use.</li><li><strong>Heat oil:</strong> Warm oil to 65-75°C (temperature range called the "sweet spot")</li><li><strong>Combine:</strong> Slowly pour lye water into warm oil while stirring continuously. Temperature will rise slightly from exothermic reaction.</li><li><strong>Stir:</strong> Continue stirring 5-15 minutes until trace appears (mixture resembles pudding)</li><li><strong>Pour:</strong> Pour mixture into molds lined with parchment paper</li><li><strong>Insulate:</strong> Wrap molds in blanket or place in insulated box. Insulation maintains heat for saponification to complete (crucial step).</li><li><strong>Cure:</strong> Allow 24 hours in molds before unmolding. Cut into bars.</li><li><strong>Air dry:</strong> Cure bars on shelves for 4-6 weeks (soap hardens as water evaporates)</li></ol><h3>Lye Water Preparation:</h3><p>Measure lye precisely (scale required). Add lye to water slowly (reaction heats water). Allow to cool to room temperature. Cloud/crystalline appearance normal (potassium carbonate crystallization). Strain through cloth if necessary.</p><div class="warning"><strong>Safety Warning:</strong> Lye is caustic. Skin contact causes chemical burns. Inhalation damages lungs. Always wear: rubber gloves (not latex), eye protection, apron. Work in ventilated area. Have vinegar available to neutralize accidental contact (apply after rinsing with water).</div></section><section id="hot-process"><h2>Hot Process Soap Making</h2><p>Faster alternative: saponification occurs at high temperature (120°C+), completing in 30-60 minutes rather than 4-6 weeks.</p><h3>Process:</h3><ol><li><strong>Combine oil and lye:</strong> Same as cold process</li><li><strong>Heat:</strong> Place mixture in large pot over fire/stove. Heat to 120-130°C, stirring regularly.</li><li><strong>Watch transformation:</strong> Mixture goes through phases: thin, thick (trace), then separates (oils rise, brownish liquid below). Separation indicates saponification is complete.</li><li><strong>Optional: add salt:</strong> Add 15-20% salt by oil weight to cause soap to precipitate (separate from liquid).</li><li><strong>Cool in molds:</strong> Pour into molds. Mixture sets quickly (1-2 hours) unlike cold process.</li><li><strong>Light cure time:</strong> Only 1-2 weeks additional drying (compared to 4-6 weeks cold process).</li></ol><h3>Advantage vs. Disadvantage:</h3><p><strong>Advantage:</strong> Much faster production. Soap usable in weeks rather than months. Ideal for survival situations needing quick turnaround.</p><p><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Higher temperature can damage scents and additives. Soap texture/appearance less refined. Lye odor may remain (cold process allows lye smell to dissipate during cure).</p></section><section id="ingredients"><h2>Oil & Fat Selection</h2><table><tr><th scope="row">Oil/Fat</th><th scope="row">Lye Needed (Saponification Value)</th><th scope="row">Bar Quality</th><th scope="row">Notes</th></tr><tr><td>Tallow (beef fat)</td><td>0.141 NaOH/oz</td><td>Hard, stable</td><td>Survives well; produces dense bars</td></tr><tr><td>Lard (pork fat)</td><td>0.141 NaOH/oz</td><td>Soft, creamy</td><td>Creates fine lather; easy to obtain</td></tr><tr><td>Coconut Oil</td><td>0.183 NaOH/oz</td><td>Hard, cleansing</td><td>Creates lots of bubbles; high lye requirement</td></tr><tr><td>Olive Oil</td><td>0.135 NaOH/oz</td><td>Soft, mild</td><td>Slow to cure; add coconut oil for hardness</td></tr><tr><td>Palm Oil</td><td>0.183 NaOH/oz</td><td>Hard, stable</td><td>Similar to coconut; environmental concerns</td></tr><tr><td>Goat fat</td><td>0.138 NaOH/oz</td><td>Soft, mild</td><td>Excellent for sensitive skin</td></tr></table><h3>Saponification Values Reference</h3><p>The saponification value (SAP value) represents the amount of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in grams needed to saponify 1 gram of oil or fat. This table helps calculate exact lye requirements for any oil:</p><table><tr><th scope="row">Oil/Fat</th><th scope="row">SAP Value (NaOH grams/gram oil)</th><th scope="row">Alternative Unit</th></tr><tr><td>Tallow</td><td>0.141</td><td>141 mg/g</td></tr><tr><td>Olive oil</td><td>0.135</td><td>135 mg/g</td></tr><tr><td>Coconut oil</td><td>0.183</td><td>183 mg/g</td></tr><tr><td>Lard</td><td>0.141</td><td>141 mg/g</td></tr><tr><td>Goat fat</td><td>0.138</td><td>138 mg/g</td></tr></table><h3>Lye Concentration Testing: The Egg Float Test</h3><p>Before using lye for soap, test its concentration to ensure proper saponification. An understrength lye solution produces incomplete soap (oily, slimy bars). Overstrong lye creates caustic soap that burns skin. The egg float test provides reliable concentration verification without specialized equipment:</p><div class="warning"><strong>Egg Float Method:</strong> Place a raw egg (in its shell) in a container of lye water. The correct lye concentration exists when the egg floats with exactly a quarter-sized area (approximately 1/4 inch or 0.5 cm diameter circle) exposed above the liquid surface. At this concentration, the lye water has a pH around 13 and a specific gravity of approximately 1.04-1.06 g/mL—ideal for soap making.</div><p><strong>If egg sinks:</strong> Lye is too weak. Add more lye to the water (always lye to water, never water to lye) until the egg floats at the correct level.</p><p><strong>If too much egg is exposed:</strong> Lye is too strong. Dilute carefully with small amounts of water until the egg floats with the correct quarter-sized area exposed.</p><p><strong>Why this works:</strong> The salt concentration in the lye solution changes the liquid's density. At the correct concentration for soap-making, an egg is perfectly buoyant with just a small area protruding. This simple test has been used for centuries by soap makers without access to modern pH meters or refractometers.</p><h3>Hard Water Adjustments</h3><p>Hard water contains dissolved minerals (calcium, magnesium) that interfere with soap-making, reducing lather and creating a sticky residue. If your water is hard, adjust your soap recipe:</p><ul><li><strong>Identify hard water:</strong> If tap water produces little lather and leaves a film on hands, it's hard. </li><li><strong>Adjustment 1 - Increase lye:</strong> Hard water requires 10-15% more sodium hydroxide than soft water. If your base recipe calls for 100g NaOH, use 110-115g instead.</li><li><strong>Adjustment 2 - Soften water beforehand:</strong> Boil hard water and allow it to cool. Much of the hardness minerals precipitate out as a fine sediment. Carefully decant the clear liquid (discarding the sediment) for soap-making.</li><li><strong>Adjustment 3 - Add washing soda:</strong> Mix 1-2 tablespoons of washing soda (sodium carbonate, Na₂CO₃) per gallon of water. Let settle for 1-2 hours, then decant the clarified water. The washing soda precipitates hardness minerals, creating soft water suitable for soap.</li></ul><h3>Sourcing Fats:</h3><p><strong>Survival context:</strong> Tallow and lard most accessible (animal slaughter byproducts). Collect fat from butchering; render by slow heating (melting). Filter through cloth to remove solids. Store in sealed containers.</p><p><strong>Plant oils:</strong> Coconut oil difficult in non-tropical regions. Olive oil available in Mediterranean climates. Sunflower/safflower seeds can be oil-pressed if equipment available.</p></section><section id="curing"><h2>Curing & Storage</h2><h3>Curing Process:</h3><p>Soap hardens and improves as water evaporates. Initial bars are soft and dissolve too quickly. Cured bars (4-6 weeks old) are hard, dense, and long-lasting. Store cured soap in well-ventilated location (air circulation aids drying). Temperature: 15-25°C optimal.</p><h3>Testing for Cure:</h3><ul><li><strong>Firmness:</strong> Squeeze bar—properly cured soap resists compression</li><li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Color lightens as water evaporates; surface may become slightly chalky (normal soda ash)</li><li><strong>Smell:</strong> Lye smell dissipates during cure; pleasant scent emerges</li><li><strong>Lather:</strong> Cured soap produces creamy lather; fresh soap produces thin, watery lather</li></ul><h3>Long-Term Storage:</h3><p>Properly cured soap stores indefinitely if kept dry. Wrapping in cloth or parchment paper prevents dust accumulation and allows continued air circulation. Soap hardens further with age; very old soap becomes rock-hard but still usable.</p></section><section id="specialty"><h2>Specialty Soaps & Additives</h2><h3>Scent Additives:</h3><ul><li><strong>Essential oils:</strong> Add at end of saponification (high temperature destroys scent). 5-10% by oil weight typical. Examples: lavender, eucalyptus, pine.</li><li><strong>Dried herbs:</strong> Add to finished soap bars for visual appeal and gentle scent. Lavender buds, rose petals, herb powders.</li><li><strong>Natural fragrance:</strong> Pine tar, birch bark oil, herbal infusions create rustic scents appropriate for survival context.</li></ul><h3>Texture Additives:</h3><ul><li><strong>Oatmeal/cornmeal:</strong> 5-10% by weight for light exfoliation and visual texture</li><li><strong>Clay:</strong> 5% by weight adds color and slight cleansing properties. Bentonite/kaolin clays safe in soap.</li><li><strong>Charcoal:</strong> 1-2% by weight creates black soap with deodorizing properties</li></ul><h3>Color Additives:</h3><p>Natural pigments: iron oxide (brown, red, yellow), mica (shimmer), activated charcoal (black), clay (earth tones). Add at trace before pouring into molds. Synthetic dyes: acceptable but less natural. Avoid food coloring (water-based, bleeds out of soap).</p><h3>Medicinal Additions:</h3><ul><li><strong>Honey:</strong> 1-2% by oil weight for moisturizing properties</li><li><strong>Milk (goat/cow):</strong> Replace 10% of water with milk for creamy, moisturizing bars</li><li><strong>Aloe vera:</strong> Adds soothing properties; use gel only (avoid water content issues)</li></ul></section><section id="safety"><h2>Safety Protocols</h2><h3>Workspace Setup:</h3><ul><li>Dedicated area away from living spaces (lye odor)</li><li>Stove/heat source for temperature control</li><li>Large pot with thermometer (immersion type, 0-200°C range)</li><li>Measuring scale (precision essential for lye calculations)</li><li>Wooden spoon or stick (never metal, reacts with lye)</li><li>Rubber gloves (full-arm protection ideal)</li><li>Eye protection (goggles)</li><li>Apron (chemical-resistant preferred)</li></ul><h3>Lye Handling Safety:</h3><ul><li>Always add lye to water, never water to lye</li><li>Stir lye solution carefully (exothermic reaction is hot)</li><li>Never touch lye water or soap mixture during saponification</li><li>Vinegar neutralizes lye (keep bottle nearby)</li><li>Wash hands immediately after work</li><li>Do not allow children/pets near workspace</li></ul><h3>Precautions During Cooling:</h3><p>Soap remains caustic throughout saponification process. Do not touch mixture. Do not breathe vapors. Ensure adequate ventilation. After molding, soap is no longer dangerous (lye fully reacted with oil).</p></section><section id="common-mistakes"><h2>Common Mistakes & Solutions</h2><h3>Mistake 1: Incorrect Lye Calculation</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Using wrong amount of lye (typical: too little lye). Results: oily, slimy soap that never hardens. Unusable.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use precise scale to weigh lye and oil. Calculate lye need based on oil type (SAP value). Cross-check calculations with multiple sources.</p><h3>Mistake 2: Inadequate Insulation (Cold Process)</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Soap cools too quickly; saponification stalls. Soap separates into layers (oils on top, liquid below). Appearance unpleasant; texture grainy.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Wrap molds immediately after pouring. Insulate with blankets/coolers. Maintain heat 24+ hours for complete saponification.</p><h3>Mistake 3: Temperature Mismanagement</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Starting at wrong temperature (too hot or too cold). If too hot: mixture seizes (hardens instantly, unworkable). If too cold: mixture takes hours to trace.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Maintain 65-75°C sweet spot (cold process). Check temperature with thermometer before combining oils and lye. Adjust heat source accordingly.</p><h3>Mistake 4: Insufficient Curing</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Using soap before 4-week cure. Bars are soft, dissolve quickly, remain caustic (can burn skin). Poor quality bars.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Cure minimum 4 weeks (6 weeks better). Test firmness before use. Only gift/sell properly cured soap.</p></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="con-03-clay-earthworks.html">Clay & Earthworks (for Containers)</a><a href="cra-03-cordage-textiles.html">Cordage Making</a><a href="cra-05-weaving-textiles.html">Weaving & Textiles</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
