Typical response includes: fear/anxiety, confusion, difficulty concentrating, physical symptoms (trembling, rapid heartbeat, nausea). Most people demonstrate adaptive response: focus on immediate survival tasks. Some experience dissociation (emotional numbness, disconnection from reality).</p><h3>Crisis Phases</h3><p><strong>Impact phase (during):</strong> Intense emotion, possible dissociation, variable competence (some function optimally, others freeze). <strong>Recoil phase (immediate after):</strong> Shock, denial, mechanical functioning (going through motions). <strong>Recovery phase (days/weeks):</strong> Emotion surfacing, fatigue, grief processing, gradual adaptation. <strong>Reconstruction phase (weeks+):</strong> Building new normal, meaning-making, resilience building or maladaptive patterns.</p><h3>Survival as Protective Factor</h3><p>Action/purpose provides psychological protection: people with roles/responsibilities demonstrate better psychological adjustment than passive evacuees/dependent persons. Engagement in survival tasks reduces rumination and despair. Cognitive focus on present (food, shelter, safety) reduces catastrophic future thinking. Work ethic and contribution to group boosts morale/purpose.</p></section><section id="ptsd"><h2>PTSD and Trauma</h2><h3>PTSD Symptoms</h3><p><strong>Re-experiencing:</strong> Flashbacks (unwanted vivid recollections), nightmares, emotional reactivity to reminders, intrusive memories (interrupting daily tasks). <strong>Avoidance:</strong> Avoiding reminders (places, people, activities), emotional numbing, dissociation. <strong>Negative cognition:</strong> Persistent negative beliefs (self-blame, shame, persistent fear, loss of trust). <strong>Hyperarousal:</strong> Hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, irritability/aggressive outbursts, reckless behavior.</p><h3>Trauma Processing</h3><p>Traumatic memories different from normal memories: fragmented, emotional rather than factual, difficult to verbalize. Recovery involves: 1) Safety establishment (reducing threat, rebuilding trust in self/others). 2) Remembrance/mourning (processing fragmented memories, integrating into life story). 3) Reconnection (rebuilding relationships, sense of purpose, meaning-making from trauma).</p><h3>PTSD Management</h3><ul><li><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):</strong> Identifying thoughts/behaviors perpetuating PTSD, challenging maladaptive beliefs, behavioral experiments (exposure therapy = gradually facing feared reminders). Limited access in survival but principles (identifying triggers, gradual exposure, thought-challenging) helpful.<li><strong>Medications:</strong> SSRIs (sertraline, paroxetine) first-line for PTSD if available. Prazosin for nightmares. Limited availability in survival scenarios.<li><strong>Supportive care:</strong> Grounding techniques (5 senses awareness: 5 things seen, 4 heard, 3 felt, 2 smelled, 1 tasted), mindfulness, peer support, meaningful activity.</ul><h3>Recognizing Severe PTSD</h3><p>Functional impairment (unable to work/care for self), suicidal ideation/behavior, substance abuse (self-medication), dissociative episodes lasting hours. These indicate need for intensive intervention (if available); if not, focus on safety and crisis management.</p></section><section id="grief"><h2>Grief and Loss</h2><h3>Grief Process</h3><p>Grief non-linear: moving through stages doesn't follow strict sequence. <strong>Denial/shock:</strong> Initial numbness, "this can't be real." <strong>Anger:</strong> "Why me?" directed at God, others, self. <strong>Bargaining:</strong> Hypothetical negotiations ("If only..."), attempt to undo loss. <strong>Sadness/depression:</strong> Accepting reality, deep emotion. <strong>Acceptance:</strong> Integrating loss, rebuilding identity.</p><h3>Complicated Grief</h3><p>Prolonged grief (>12 months, intensifying rather than improving): intense yearning, difficulty accepting death, loss of purpose/identity tied to deceased, suicidal ideation. Triggers: multiple losses, previous trauma, ambiguous loss (missing/presumed dead persons), inadequate support. Requires: individual support (grief counseling, EMDR if trained practitioner available), community ritual/acknowledgment.</p><h3>Grief Support</h3><ul><li>Create rituals: funeral/memorial (even simple), marking death/loss acknowledges significance<li>Normalize expression: all grief emotions valid; don't suppress or hurry grieving person<li>Provide practical support: help with tasks, meal preparation (grieving person often can't manage basic self-care)<li>Listen without judgment: grieving person needs to tell story repeatedly; repetition aids integration<li>Share memories: collective remembering honors deceased, provides comfort<li>Avoid minimization: don't say "they're in a better place" or "be grateful for time together"—focus on person's loss and pain</ul></section><section id="anxiety-depression"><h2>Anxiety and Depression in Crisis</h2><h3>Depression Symptoms</h3><p>Low mood (not necessarily sadness—often numbness/anhedonia—loss of pleasure), fatigue, sleep disruption (too much/too little), appetite loss, difficulty concentrating, feelings of worthlessness/guilt, reduced activity/motivation, thoughts of death. In survival: depression can manifest as giving up, not engaging in necessary tasks, increased illness vulnerability.</p><h3>Anxiety Symptoms</h3><p>Persistent worry (about unknown future, resource scarcity, harm), physical symptoms (chest tightness, rapid heartbeat, breathing difficulty, trembling), panic attacks (acute severe anxiety with physical symptoms), hypervigilance (constantly scanning for threats). In survival: some anxiety appropriate (realistic threat assessment); excessive anxiety = paralyzing.</p><h3>Crisis-Relevant Anxiety/Depression</h3><p>Survival situation generates realistic threat; some anxiety/depression normal. Differentiate: 1) Normal/proportional emotional response (sadness about losses, anxiety about real threats). 2) Pathological response (inability to function, suicidal thoughts, complete withdrawal). Management: acknowledge reality/threat (validation—emotions appropriate), encourage purposeful activity (reduces rumination), peer support, maintain routine/structure.</p></section><section id="children"><h2>Children's Psychological Needs</h2><h3>Children's Responses to Crisis</h3><p><strong>Young children (4-6):</strong> Limited understanding of danger, fear of separation from caregiver, regressive behaviors (bed-wetting, thumb-sucking), clinging/clinginess. <strong>Older children (7-12):</strong> Understanding of danger/death, worry about safety, guilt/self-blame, behavioral problems, difficulty concentrating. <strong>Adolescents:</strong> Abstract thinking (catastrophizing possible futures), identity issues, risk-taking behavior, depression/withdrawal, peer-dependence important.</p><h3>Supporting Children</h3><ul><li><strong>Maintain safety and routine:</strong> Predictable schedules, safe spaces, caregiver consistency<li><strong>Honest, age-appropriate information:</strong> Children sense dishonesty; provide truthful explanations at developmental level<li><strong>Emotional validation:</strong> "It's okay to feel scared/sad" normalizes emotion, reduces shame<li><strong>Reassurance of caregiver commitment:</strong> Repeatedly confirm adult will protect/care for child<li><strong>Involvement in age-appropriate tasks:</strong> Sense of competence and contribution (gathering firewood, caring for animals)<li><strong>Watchfulness for trauma signs:</strong> Behavioral change, sleep disruption, regression, acting-out; address with support/talking</ul><h3>Preventing Childhood Trauma</h3><p>Exposure to graphic violence/death: minimize if possible. Remove children from severely traumatic scenes. If cannot avoid, provide support immediately afterward: talk about what happened, normalize emotions, provide physical comfort. Children with strong caregiver relationships demonstrate better resilience despite trauma exposure.</p></section><section id="community"><h2>Community Psychological Support</h2><h3>Building Social Cohesion</h3><p>Humans are social; group survival > individual survival. Community reduces stress (distributed responsibility, shared purpose), provides emotional support (mutual aid), increases motivation (purposeful contribution). Isolated survivors = higher psychological casualty risk. Encourage: group meals, shared labor, collective decision-making (even if input limited), celebration/ritual (marking milestones boosts morale).</p><h3>Leadership and Morale</h3><p>Clear, calm leadership reduces panic/uncertainty. Leaders should: 1) Project confidence (even if uncertain). 2) Provide clear information (rumors kill morale faster than bad truth). 3) Include community in decisions (investment in collective survival increases effort). 4) Recognize individual contributions (appreciation prevents learned helplessness). 5) Maintain structure (routines, roles reduce chaos/anxiety).</p><h3>Conflict Resolution</h3><p>Stress/scarcity increase conflict. Establish: 1) Dispute resolution process (mediation, clear consequences). 2) Fair resource allocation (perceived injustice generates resentment, undermines community). 3) Communication forums (regular meetings allow grievances). 4) Conflict containment (prevent escalation to violence, factions). Unresolved conflict = community fragmentation, loss of collective strength.</p></section><section id="coping"><h2>Resilience-Building and Coping Strategies</h2><h3>Adaptive Coping Strategies</h3><ul><li><strong>Problem-focused:</strong> Direct action on stressors (gathering food, improving shelter). Reduces stress through sense of agency.<li><strong>Emotion-focused:</strong> Managing emotional response (talking, crying, physical activity). Processing emotion prevents accumulation/pathology.<li><strong>Social support:</strong> Relationships, community. Buffer against despair, provide practical help.<li><strong>Meaning-making:</strong> Finding purpose in survival (testing capabilities, contributing to group, ensuring family survival). Provides motivation beyond basic survival.</ul><h3>Resilience Factors</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Factor<th scope="row">Description<th scope="row">Promotion Strategy<tr><td>Self-efficacy<td>Belief in ability to manage challenges<td>Start with achievable goals, celebrate successes<tr><td>Optimism<td>Hope for future, belief in positive outcomes<td>Focus on progress, avoid catastrophic thinking<tr><td>Social support<td>Quality relationships with others<td>Invest in community, maintain connections<tr><td>Purpose/meaning<td>Sense that life has meaning/purpose<td>Engage in valued activities, care for others<tr><td>Flexibility<td>Adaptability to changing circumstances<td>Problem-solve creatively, avoid rigidity<tr><td>Self-care<td>Meeting basic needs: sleep, nutrition, hygiene<td>Prioritize rest, nutrition, basic health</table><h3>Daily Resilience Practice</h3><p><strong>Grounding techniques:</strong> 5 senses awareness (reduces dissociation, anxiety). <strong>Mindfulness:</strong> Present-moment focus (reduces worry about future). <strong>Physical activity:</strong> Reduces stress hormones, improves mood. <strong>Gratitude:</strong> Focusing on small positives (food, shelter, community) shifts perspective. <strong>Creative expression:</strong> Art, music, storytelling processes emotion, builds community. <strong>Humor:</strong> Laughter reduces stress, builds camaraderie (though situationally appropriate).</p></section><section id="safety"><div class="warning"><h3>Critical Mental Health Warnings</h3><ul><li>Suicidal ideation = immediate crisis. Maintain safety (remove means), listen non-judgmentally, connect with support (trusted person, community). If available, psychiatric intervention essential.<li>Psychotic symptoms (hearing voices, delusions, disorganization) = serious mental health emergency. Support safety, reduce stimulation, attempt calm reassurance. If medication available (antipsychotics), consider use (only trained provider).<li>Substance abuse as self-medication = addiction risk. Encourage alternative coping; if addiction develops, withdrawal can be dangerous (alcohol withdrawal seizures, severe depression). Taper carefully if possible.<li>Compassion fatigue in providers = burnout, emotional exhaustion. Caregivers need support/breaks; rotate responsibility to prevent depletion.</ul></div></section><section id="mistakes"><div class="mistakes"><h3>Common Psychological Support Errors</h3><ul><li><strong>Minimizing grief:</strong> Saying "move on" or "at least..." invalidates loss, delays processing. Listen, validate, allow time.<li><strong>Forced cheerfulness:</strong> Denying sadness/fear doesn't eliminate emotions; leads to depression/anxiety later.<li><strong>Ignoring children's needs:</strong> Assuming children resilient/unaffected = missed trauma; provide support proactively.<li><strong>Isolation of distressed individuals:</strong> Removing troubled person from community increases despair, makes intervention harder. Include, support, maintain connection.<li><strong>Pressure to "be strong":</strong> Emotional expression not weakness; processing feelings essential. Allow vulnerability, normalize emotion.</ul></div></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="first-aid.html">First Aid</a> • <a href="infection-control.html">Infection Control</a> • <a href="medications.html">Essential Medications</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
