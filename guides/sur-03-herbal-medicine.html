Wrong plant identification can be fatal. Use multiple identification features: leaf shape, stem characteristics, flowers, root structure, smell, and habitat.</p><h3>Identification Features to Document</h3><ul><li>Leaf arrangement (opposite, alternate, whorled)</li><li>Leaf shape (oval, lanceolate, serrated, smooth)</li><li>Stem characteristics (smooth, hairy, woody, herbaceous)</li><li>Flowers (color, number of petals, arrangement)</li><li>Fruit or seed characteristics</li><li>Root type (taproot, fibrous, rhizome)</li><li>Habitat (wet, dry, shaded, sunny)</li><li>Season when found</li><li>Height and growth pattern</li></ul><h3>Identification Safety Rule</h3><p>If identification uncertain in ANY way, do not use. Many toxic plants resemble edible ones. Example: Poison hemlock appears similar to wild carrot and parsnip. When in doubt, go without rather than risk poisoning.</p><h3>Dichotomous Key Use</h3><p>Field guides with dichotomous keys provide reliable identification through sequential yes/no questions about plant features. Cross-reference multiple keys to confirm identification. Never rely on single source for identification.</p></section><section id="preparation"><h2>Preparation Methods</h2><p>Different preparation methods extract active compounds efficiently. Selection depends on herb type and desired effect.</p><h3>Tea Infusion</h3><p>Steeping method for leaves and flowers. Use 1 teaspoon dried herb per cup of boiling water. Steep 5-10 minutes. Strain through cloth. Drink warm or cooled. Tastes better than other methods. Best for: chamomile, peppermint, willow bark, plantain. Infusions stay fresh 24 hours in cool conditions.</p><h3>Decoction</h3><p>Boiling method for roots, bark, and hard woody parts. Place 1 teaspoon dried herb in pot with 1 cup water. Bring to boil, simmer 10-20 minutes. Strain. More potent than infusions, extracts compounds not soluble in hot water alone. Best for: ginger, willow bark, hawthorn. Stronger taste than infusions.</p><h3>Tincture Production</h3><p>Alcohol extraction for concentrated preparation. Fill jar with fresh herb (or 1/3 jar with dried herb), cover completely with alcohol (vodka, moonshine, any 40%+ alcohol). Seal jar, store dark location. Shake daily. After 2-4 weeks, strain through cloth. Tinctures last months to years. Dosage: 20-30 drops in water, 2-3 times daily. Most concentrated preparation method.</p><h3>Poultice Application</h3><p>Direct application to skin for wounds, inflammation. Mash fresh herb into paste using mortar and pestle (or between stones). Apply directly to affected area. Cover with cloth. Change every 2-4 hours. Poultices draw inflammation, kill bacteria, promote healing. Best for: plantain, comfrey, calendula.</p><h3>Salve/Ointment Creation</h3><p>Herb-infused oil mixed with wax for skin application. Warm oil (coconut, animal fat, or rendered plant oil), add crushed herb, simmer gently 1-2 hours. Strain through cloth. Mix with melted beeswax or plant wax at 3:1 oil to wax ratio. Cool in containers. Salves protect wounds, reduce infection risk, moisturize skin.</p><h3>Compress</h3><p>Cloth soaked in herbal tea, applied to affected area. Useful for sprains, inflammation, wounds. Prepare strong infusion or decoction, soak cloth, apply while warm. Reheating allows longer use. Best for: inflammation, sprains, some wounds.</p></section><section id="common"><h2>Common Medicinal Plants</h2><h3>Plantain (Plantago major/minor)</h3><p>One of most useful survival herbs. Leaves contain mucilage and antimicrobial compounds. Raw leaves can be chewed or made into poultice for cuts, stings, and minor wounds. Use: mash fresh leaves on wound, apply as poultice 2-4 times daily. Infusion helps with respiratory issues. Found nearly worldwide in disturbed areas. Identification: broad oval leaves in basal rosette, parallel veins, small flowers on tall spike.</p><h3>Willow Bark</h3><p>Natural aspirin source. Contains salicin which converts to salicylic acid in body. Reduces fever, pain, inflammation. Prepare decoction: simmer 1 teaspoon bark 10-15 minutes. Drink 2-3 cups daily. Taste bitter. Safe for adults but NOT for children under 12 or aspirin-allergic individuals. Harvest bark in spring for best potency.</p><h3>Ginger Root</h3><p>Warming herb for digestion, nausea, inflammation. Use fresh rhizomes when available or dried. Tea: grate thumb-size piece fresh ginger, steep in hot water 5-10 minutes. Reduces nausea, aids digestion. Can be eaten raw in small amounts. Warming effect useful in cold conditions.</p><h3>Chamomile</h3><p>Calming herb for anxiety, insomnia, digestive upset. Dried flowers steep 5-10 minutes. Mild flavor, easy to prepare. Safe for most people. Helps induce sleep when 30-60 minutes before bed. Also helps with mild digestive issues.</p><h3>Peppermint</h3><p>Digestive aid, pain relief. Fresh or dried leaves steep 5-10 minutes. Cooling effect useful in heat, warming in cold (stimulates circulation). Helps with headaches, stomach cramps, nausea. Safe for most but not large amounts during pregnancy.</p><h3>Echinacea (Purple Coneflower)</h3><p>Immune support herb. Root and aerial parts used. Tincture or decoction. Drink at first sign of infection. Most effective when used early in illness. Root stronger than leaves. Use for: minor infections, common cold, wound healing.</p><h3>St. John's Wort</h3><p>Mood support herb. Yellow flowers and leaves used. Requires 2-4 weeks regular use for effectiveness. Tincture or infusion. WARNING: significantly interacts with many medications. Do not use if on pharmaceuticals without medical approval.</p><h3>Yarrow</h3><p>Wound healer, fever reducer, anti-inflammatory. Feathery foliage, flat flower clusters (white, pink, yellow). Poultice or infusion. Leaves can be chewed for bleeding wounds (promotes clotting). Bitter tea helps reduce fever by promoting sweating.</p><h3>Comfrey</h3><p>Bone and wound healing. Root used primarily. Decoction or poultice applied to sprains, fractures, wounds. Promotes rapid healing but contains compounds that can accumulate in liver with extended use. Use externally primarily, limit internal use to 2-3 weeks maximum.</p><h3>Garlic</h3><p>Antimicrobial, antibacterial. Fresh cloves most powerful. Can be eaten raw or cooked. Helps prevent infections, boost immunity. Pungent taste acceptable when raw. Cooked is milder. Use liberally for food as well as medicine.</p></section><section id="dosing"><h2>Dosing and Administration</h2><h3>Standard Tea Dosage</h3><p>1-3 cups daily for acute conditions (colds, flu). 1 cup daily for maintenance. Spread dosage throughout day. Most herbs have narrow margin between effective and excessive dose - when uncertain, use lower doses.</p><h3>Tincture Dosage</h3><p>20-40 drops in water, 2-3 times daily. Some bitter herbs can be taken straight on tongue, though less pleasant. Alcohol concentration preserves tinctures but not suitable for young children.</p><h3>Decoction Dosage</h3><p>1/4 to 1/2 cup, 2-4 times daily. For strong decoctions, smaller doses. Start with smaller amounts to assess tolerance. More potent than infusions - don't assume same dosage as teas.</p><h3>Poultice Frequency</h3><p>Change poultice 2-4 times daily for acute wounds. Less frequently (once daily) for chronic conditions. Cover with cloth to prevent bacterial contamination.</p><h3>Duration of Use</h3><p>Acute illness: use 5-7 days then reassess. If improving, continue shorter course. If not improving, try different herb or seek additional help. Some herbs for maintenance can be used indefinitely (ginger, garlic). Others should be cycled (echinacea - 2 weeks on, 1 week off; St. John's wort - requires continuous use to be effective).</p><h3>Individual Variation</h3><p>Children use 1/4 to 1/2 adult dose depending on age. Elderly may respond to smaller doses. Pregnant women avoid most herbs - consult sources before use. Body weight affects dosing - larger individuals may need slight increases.</p></section><section id="safety"><h2>Safety Considerations</h2><p>Herbal medicine can be powerful but requires respect and caution.</p><div class="warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Do not use herbs as substitute for emergency medical care. Serious infections, severe wounds, or life-threatening conditions require professional medical treatment. Use herbs for support, not primary treatment of serious illness.</div><h3>Toxicity Concerns</h3><p>Some plants contain toxic compounds even if related species are safe. Digitalis (foxglove) contains cardiac glycosides - even small amounts can cause heart problems. Hemlock species contain neurotoxins - lethal in small amounts. Extreme care with identification prevents tragedies.</p><h3>Contamination Risks</h3><p>Herbs harvested near roads accumulate heavy metals from vehicle exhaust. Herbicide or pesticide residues on non-organic herbs. Never harvest from areas treated with chemicals. Mold or bacterial growth in stored herbs causes illness. Keep herbs dry and properly stored.</p><h3>Overdose Prevention</h3><p>Start with smaller doses to assess tolerance. If no adverse reaction after 2-3 uses, can increase to standard dose. Some people have sensitivities to specific herbs. Monitor for: nausea, dizziness, rash, headache, stomach upset. Stop immediately if adverse effects occur.</p><h3>Preparation Cleanliness</h3><p>Use clean equipment. Sterilize containers before tincture production (boiling or alcohol rinse). Use clean water for infusions/decoctions. Improper preparation can introduce bacteria or mold.</p><h3>When to Avoid Herbal Treatment</h3><ul><li>Severe wounds requiring stitches or professional care</li><li>Signs of serious infection (fever above 39°C, spreading redness, pus)</li><li>Severe pain without identifiable cause</li><li>Suspected broken bones or internal injuries</li><li>Allergic reactions or anaphylaxis</li><li>Unconsciousness or altered mental state</li></ul></section><section id="interactions"><h2>Drug Interactions</h2><p>Herbal medicines interact with pharmaceuticals, sometimes dangerously. If person on medication, verify herb safety before use.</p><h3>High-Risk Interactions</h3><p>St. John's Wort interferes with birth control effectiveness, blood thinners, antidepressants, and many other medications. Gingko interferes with blood thinners. Licorice interacts with blood pressure medications. Ginger may thin blood slightly (avoid with blood thinners). Turmeric may increase bleeding risk.</p><h3>Interaction Severity</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Interaction Type</th><th scope="row">Risk Level</th><th scope="row">Example</th></tr><tr><td>Reduced drug effectiveness</td><td>Medium</td><td>St. John's Wort + Birth Control</td></tr><tr><td>Increased drug levels</td><td>High</td><td>Grapefruit + Statins</td></tr><tr><td>Additive effects</td><td>High</td><td>Ginger + Warfarin (bleeding)</td></tr><tr><td>Antagonistic effects</td><td>Medium</td><td>Herb opposing drug purpose</td></tr></table><h3>Safe Herb and Drug Combinations</h3><p>Plantain generally safe with medications (topical use). Chamomile minimal interaction risk. Peppermint minimal risk. Garlic slight blood thinning effect (monitor with anticoagulants). When uncertain, use herbs known as food (garlic, ginger) rather than medicinal-only herbs.</p><h3>Documentation</h3><p>If treating someone on medications, document any herbs used. If person receives outside medical care, inform providers of herbal treatments used. Some reactions may be attributed to pharmaceutical interactions rather than herb toxicity.</p></section><section id="harvesting"><h2>Seasonal Harvesting</h2><p>Plant potency varies by season and plant part. Harvest at peak potency for best results.</p><h3>Harvesting Schedule</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Plant Part</th><th scope="row">Best Season</th><th scope="row">Timing</th><th scope="row">Notes</th></tr><tr><td>Aerial (leaves/flowers)</td><td>Spring-Summer</td><td>Just before flowering</td><td>Peak potency before flowering</td></tr><tr><td>Flowers</td><td>Summer</td><td>When fully open</td><td>Dry immediately after collection</td></tr><tr><td>Roots/Rhizomes</td><td>Fall/Spring</td><td>Fall after foliage dies</td><td>Skip flowering season</td></tr><tr><td>Bark</td><td>Spring</td><td>Sap flowing</td><td>Most potent in spring</td></tr><tr><td>Seeds</td><td>Late Summer</td><td>Just before falling</td><td>Dry completely before storage</td></tr></table><h3>Harvesting Rules</h3><ul><li>Never harvest entire plant - leave roots to regenerate</li><li>Don't take more than 1/3 of plant population in area</li><li>Harvest sustainably - return to same location annually</li><li>Use sharp tools to cleanly cut (crushing damages plant)</li><li>Morning harvesting (after dew dries) best for potency</li><li>Avoid plants near roads, contamination sources</li></ul><h3>Drying and Storage</h3><p>Dry herbs in shade with good air circulation. Direct sun degrades active compounds. Hang upside down or lay on cloth. Completely dry (brittle, not bendable) before storage. Store in cool, dark, dry location in sealed containers. Properly dried herbs last 6-12 months. Discard if mold, discoloration, or off-smell develops.</p><h3>Storage Duration</h3><p>Leaves/flowers: 6-12 months (less potent after 6). Roots/bark: 1-2 years. Dried teas decline in potency after 6 months. Tinctures last 2-5 years. Fresh herbs use immediately or process same day.</p></section><section><h2>Herbal Medicine Summary</h2><table><tr><th scope="row">Herb</th><th scope="row">Uses</th><th scope="row">Preparation</th><th scope="row">Dose</th><th scope="row">Safety</th></tr><tr><td>Plantain</td><td>Wounds, stings</td><td>Poultice, tea</td><td>Topical 2-4x/day</td><td>Safe, no toxicity</td></tr><tr><td>Willow Bark</td><td>Pain, fever</td><td>Decoction</td><td>1 cup 2-3x daily</td><td>Avoid pregnancy, aspirin allergy</td></tr><tr><td>Ginger</td><td>Nausea, digestion</td><td>Tea, fresh</td><td>Thumb size 2-3x daily</td><td>Safe, slight blood thinning</td></tr><tr><td>Chamomile</td><td>Sleep, digestion</td><td>Infusion</td><td>1 cup before bed</td><td>Very safe</td></tr><tr><td>Peppermint</td><td>Pain, digestion</td><td>Infusion</td><td>1 cup 2-3x daily</td><td>Safe, avoid excess pregnancy</td></tr><tr><td>Yarrow</td><td>Wounds, fever</td><td>Poultice, tea</td><td>1 cup 2-3x daily</td><td>Safe externally, limit internal</td></tr><tr><td>Garlic</td><td>Infection prevention</td><td>Raw, cooked</td><td>1-2 cloves daily</td><td>Safe, slight blood thinning</td></tr></table></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="sur-01-water-purification.html">Water Purification (for preparing infusions)</a> | <a href="sur-02-fire-starting.html">Fire Starting (for heat)</a> | <a href="sur-05-sanitation-hygiene.html">Sanitation (wound prevention)</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
