Prenatal Care: Confirming Pregnancy & Monitoring Health </h2><h3> Early Pregnancy Recognition </h3><p> The earliest signs of pregnancy include: </p><ul><li><strong> Missed Period: </strong> Most reliable indicator. A cycle normally lasting 28-30 days that doesn't occur within 5-7 days should prompt testing. </li><li><strong> Morning Sickness: </strong> Affects 50-80% of pregnant women. Typically begins 4-6 weeks after conception, peaks around 8-10 weeks. May occur at any time of day despite its name. </li><li><strong> Breast Changes: </strong> Tenderness, swelling, darkening of areolas, prominent veins, possible colostrum expression by second or third month. </li><li><strong> Quickening (Fetal Movement): </strong> Primigravidas (first pregnancy) typically notice at 18-20 weeks; multipara (previous births) at 16-18 weeks. Initially described as "butterflies" or light fluttering. </li><li><strong> Fatigue, Urinary Frequency, Mood Changes: </strong> Common early symptoms. </li></ul><h3> Nutrition During Pregnancy </h3><p> Proper nutrition is foundational to maternal and fetal health. The pregnant body requires approximately 300 additional calories per day, with macronutrient and micronutrient increases essential: </p><h4> Critical Nutrients </h4><ul><li><strong> Protein: </strong> Increase to 70-100g daily (from baseline 50-60g). Required for fetal tissue growth, placental development, and maternal blood volume expansion. Sources: lean meats, fish, eggs, legumes, dairy. </li><li><strong> Iron: </strong> Increase to 27mg daily (from baseline 18mg). Hemoglobin levels drop 10% naturally; additional iron prevents anemia. Needed for increased blood volume and fetal stores. Sources: red meat, fortified cereals, leafy greens. Absorption enhanced by vitamin C. </li><li><strong> Folate/Folic Acid: </strong> 400-800 mcg daily minimum. Critical for DNA synthesis and neural tube development (prevents spina bifida and anencephaly). Most critical first 28 days of pregnancy. Sources: dark leafy greens, fortified grains, legumes, asparagus. </li><li><strong> Calcium: </strong> 1000-1300mg daily. Supports fetal skeletal development and maternal bone health. If inadequate, fetus extracts calcium from mother's bones. Sources: dairy, fortified plant milks, leafy greens, sardines with bones. </li><li><strong> Vitamin D: </strong> 600 IU daily. Enhances calcium absorption. Deficiency linked to gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. </li><li><strong> DHA (Omega-3): </strong> 200-300mg daily. Critical for fetal brain and eye development. Sources: fatty fish (limit to 2-3 servings weekly due to mercury), algae supplements. </li></ul><h3> Danger Signs Requiring Immediate Evaluation </h3><div class="danger-box"><h4> Red Flags in Pregnancy </h4><ul><li><strong> Vaginal Bleeding: </strong> Any amount warrants evaluation. May indicate miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, or placental issues. </li><li><strong> Severe Headache: </strong> Particularly if accompanied by visual changes or elevated blood pressure. May signal preeclampsia or other hypertensive emergency. </li><li><strong> Visual Changes: </strong> Blurred vision, flashing lights, spots, or temporary blindness. Classic preeclampsia warning. </li><li><strong> Severe/Unusual Abdominal Pain: </strong> Sharp, persistent pain may indicate ectopic pregnancy, placental abruption, or appendicitis. </li><li><strong> Severe Swelling (Edema): </strong> Especially face, hands, and feet. Combined with proteinuria and hypertension = preeclampsia. </li><li><strong> Loss of Quickening: </strong> Sudden decrease in fetal movement warrants evaluation. </li><li><strong> Fever >101°F (38.3°C): </strong> May indicate infection requiring treatment. </li><li><strong> Severe Vomiting (Hyperemesis): </strong> Inability to keep fluids down. Risk of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. </li></ul></div><h3> Preeclampsia: The "Silent Killer" </h3><p> Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific syndrome affecting 3-5% of pregnancies. Recognition saves lives: </p><ul><li><strong> Blood Pressure: </strong> Reading >140/90 mmHg (or increase of 30 mmHg systolic / 15 mmHg diastolic from baseline) warrants follow-up. </li><li><strong> Proteinuria: </strong> Protein in urine (>1+ on dipstick or >300mg in 24-hour collection) is hallmark finding. </li><li><strong> Symptoms: </strong> Severe headache (often frontal), visual disturbances, right upper quadrant pain, severe swelling. </li><li><strong> Eclampsia: </strong> Seizures indicate progression to eclampsia — a medical emergency requiring delivery of baby and magnesium sulfate. </li></ul></section><section id="timeline"><h2> 2.

Labor Stages: From Contractions to Postpartum Stabilization </h2><p> Labor is divided into four clinical stages. Understanding these guides appropriate intervention and normalcy recognition. </p><h3> Stage 1: Cervical Dilation (0-10cm) </h3><p> Contractions cause the cervix to thin (efface) and open (dilate). This longest stage is further divided: </p><h4> Early Labor (0-3cm dilation) </h4><ul><li><strong> Contractions: </strong> Irregular, 15-30 minutes apart. Mild to moderate intensity (able to walk and talk through them). </li><li><strong> Duration: </strong> Can last 8-12 hours or longer. Not all early labor progresses steadily. </li><li><strong> Mother feels: </strong> Backache, pelvic pressure, possibly loose stools, emotional anticipation or anxiety. </li><li><strong> Management: </strong> Rest, hydration, light meals, position changes, ambulation. Assess well-being and monitor for complications. </li></ul><h4> Active Labor (3-7cm dilation) </h4><ul><li><strong> Contractions: </strong> Regular, 3-5 minutes apart, lasting 40-60 seconds. Moderate to strong intensity (cannot talk through them). </li><li><strong> Duration: </strong> Typically progresses 1cm per hour (though highly variable). </li><li><strong> Mother feels: </strong> Significant pain, pressure, possible vomiting, concentration required. </li><li><strong> Management: </strong> Comfort measures intensify — position changes, breathing, support person presence. If hospital/birth center, continuous monitoring may begin. Coping techniques crucial. </li></ul><h4> Transition (7-10cm dilation) </h4><ul><li><strong> Contractions: </strong> Very strong, 2-3 minutes apart, lasting 60-90 seconds. Peak intensity. </li><li><strong> Duration: </strong> Usually short — 30 minutes to 2 hours, though can be longer. </li><li><strong> Mother feels: </strong> Intense pressure, possible involuntary shaking, nausea, doubt, emotional vulnerability, urge to push (before full dilation = dangerous). </li><li><strong> Management: </strong> Constant support, encouragement, position changes. Prevention of pushing until confirmed full dilation. Frequent reassurance that this phase is temporary. </li></ul><h3> Stage 2: Pushing & Delivery of Baby (Full dilation to birth) </h3><ul><li><strong> Duration: </strong> Typically 30 minutes to 2 hours (multipara often shorter, primigravida longer). </li><li><strong> Mother feels: </strong> Overwhelming urge to push, pressure in rectum and perineum, relief when pushing (unlike pain of contractions). </li><li><strong> Process: </strong> With each contraction, mother bears down. Baby descends gradually. As head crowns (visible at introitus), intense burning stretching felt. </li><li><strong> Management: </strong> Support upright positions, encourage pushing with contractions (not between), praise efforts, continue support. Prepare for immediate newborn care. </li></ul><h3> Stage 3: Delivery of Placenta (5-30 minutes typically) </h3><ul><li><strong> Process: </strong> After baby delivered, contractions continue (less intense). Placenta separates from uterine wall and descends. </li><li><strong> Mother feels: </strong> Relief of pressure, easier contractions. Possible desire to hold baby. Less intense focus. </li><li><strong> Signs of separation: </strong> Cord lengthens, gush of blood, uterus rises slightly as placenta descends. </li><li><strong> Delivery method: </strong> Natural (mother pushes with contractions) or active management (oxytocin given, controlled cord traction used). </li><li><strong> Danger: </strong> Retained placenta >60 minutes risks massive hemorrhage. </li></ul><h3> Stage 4: Immediate Postpartum Stabilization (First 2 hours) </h3><ul><li><strong> Mother: </strong> Uterus contracts to compress bleeding vessels. Close monitoring for hemorrhage essential. Assess perineal integrity, maternal vital signs, emotional state. </li><li><strong> Baby: </strong> Initial assessment, feeding initiation, bonding. </li><li><strong> Danger period: </strong> First 2 hours when 80% of postpartum hemorrhage occurs. </li></ul></section><section id="normal-delivery"><h2> 4. Normal Vaginal Delivery: Hands-On, Hands-Off Approach </h2><h3> Preparation for Delivery </h3><p> Cleanliness and readiness are foundational. Lack of preparation in low-resource settings accounts for preventable maternal and neonatal mortality. </p><h4> Essential Preparation </h4><ul><li><strong> Clean Space: </strong> Birth occurs on clean surface (boiled or sterilized cloth, plastic sheeting, or designated clean area). Avoid ground contact if possible. </li><li><strong> Clean Hands: </strong> Attendant washes hands thoroughly with soap and clean water immediately before delivery. Gloves if available and trained to use correctly. </li><li><strong> Warm Room: </strong> Environment maintained at comfortable temperature to prevent neonatal hypothermia. Target 25-28°C (77-82°F). </li><li><strong> Clean Receiving Blankets/Cloths: </strong> Pre-positioned for immediate drying and warming of newborn. Multiple layers if possible. </li><li><strong> Cord Tie Materials: </strong> Two clean ties prepared — traditional materials include clean shoelaces, boiled cloth strips, or sterile commercial cord clamps. Ties placed 2 inches apart. </li><li><strong> Sterile Blade for Cord Cutting: </strong> New or sterilized blade. Avoid reused blades (infection risk). </li><li><strong> Emesis Basin/Clean Container: </strong> For placenta and soiled items. </li><li><strong> Light Source: </strong> Adequate lighting to assess perineum and baby. If no electricity, clean lamp or daylight. </li></ul><h3> Maternal Positioning for Birth </h3><p> The mother's position significantly affects comfort, efficiency, and perineal injury. Supported movement and position choice empower the mother: </p><ul><li><strong> Upright/Squatting Position: </strong> Takes advantage of gravity. Opens pelvis maximally. Allows better pushing mechanics. Reduces perineal trauma. Traditional in many cultures. Requires leg support (partner, birth ball, rope). </li><li><strong> Hands-and-Knees Position: </strong> Excellent for back pain relief, posterior baby rotation, perineal protection. Less gravity assistance. Requires abdominal support. </li><li><strong> Side-Lying Position: </strong> Comfortable if fatigued. Allows controlled descent. Less pushing efficiency. Reduces perineal tearing. </li><li><strong> Supported Squat: </strong> Combines upright benefits with support. Attendant or partner behind, supporting upper back and sides. Most efficient for descent. </li><li><strong> Avoid: </strong> Lithotomy (flat on back, legs in stirrups) — increases perineal trauma, compromises circulation, reduces pushing efficiency, increases need for intervention. </li></ul><h3> Hands-Off Approach to Labor Support </h3><p> Modern midwifery emphasizes "hands-off" approach — avoiding unnecessary intervention while remaining ready to assist: </p><ul><li><strong> Don't Pull the Baby: </strong> Allow baby to descend with contractions and maternal effort. Pulling increases perineal and neonatal injury risk. </li><li><strong> Support the Perineum: </strong> As head crowns, use warm hand or warm cloth to support perineal skin. Gentle counter-pressure reduces tearing. Do not restrict head extension — allow slow progress. </li><li><strong> Guide the Head Through: </strong> As baby's head emerges, guide gently. Support neck to prevent sudden decompression (in vacuum/forceps deliveries). Allow shoulders to rotate with body (external rotation — baby's head turns to align with shoulders). </li><li><strong> Support Perineal Body: </strong> While supporting, assess for crowning complications. Presence and readiness are key, not active manipulation. </li></ul><h3> Umbilical Cord Management </h3><p> Delayed cord clamping provides significant benefits. The cord continues pulsing after birth, transferring placental blood and vital iron stores to the newborn: </p><h4> Delayed Cord Clamping Protocol </h4><ul><li><strong> Wait Duration: </strong> Minimum 2-3 minutes is ideal. Some sources recommend up to 5 minutes or until cord stops pulsing completely. Prevents anemia, improves iron stores, supports neurodevelopment. </li><li><strong> Position: </strong> Keep newborn at same level as placenta (still in uterus) to facilitate blood flow. Avoid early upward movement. </li><li><strong> Assessment: </strong> Watch for vigorous pulsing. Most pulsing stops by 3-5 minutes. If meconium-stained fluid and poor respiratory effort, expedite clamping to assess/resuscitate. </li></ul><h4> Cord Tying & Cutting </h4><ul><li><strong> Two Tie Points: </strong> Place first tie approximately 2-3 inches from umbilicus. Second tie approximately 4-5 inches from umbilicus (2 inches apart). </li><li><strong> Tie Technique: </strong> Wrap tie around cord twice, tie firmly. Cord should not compress (no white center), but ties should not slip. </li><li><strong> Cutting: </strong> Use sterile or sterilized blade. Cut cord between the two ties. Do not cut too close to infant (risk of exposure to infection). </li><li><strong> Inspection: </strong> After cutting, inspect cord end. Should not bleed. If bleeding, apply additional tie. </li></ul><div class="info-box"><h4> Cord Blood Banking </h4><p> If parents desire cord blood collection for stem cell banking, specify blood collection vials, timing, and storage facility in advance. Collection occurs after clamping and cutting, before placental delivery, if planned. </p></div></section><section id="newborn-immediate"><h2> 5. Newborn Immediate Care: First Minutes & Hours </h2><h3> Initial Newborn Assessment & Stabilization </h3><h4> Drying & Warming (Most Critical) </h4><ul><li><strong> Dry Vigorously: </strong> Immediately upon delivery, dry newborn thoroughly with clean, warm cloth. Vigorous drying stimulates breathing and removes wet covering (evaporation causes rapid heat loss). </li><li><strong> Skin-to-Skin Contact: </strong> After initial drying, place baby directly on mother's chest, covered with warm blanket. This is optimal thermal regulation method. Maintains body temperature and supports maternal-infant bonding. </li><li><strong> Hypothermia Prevention: </strong> Newborns lose heat rapidly. A newborn 0.5°C below normal has significantly increased morbidity/mortality. Ensure room temperature adequate, avoid fans, minimize exposure. </li></ul><h4> Airway Clearance </h4><ul><li><strong> Clear Airway Only if Needed: </strong> Routine suctioning of all newborns is no longer recommended — causes vagal stimulation and bradycardia. </li><li><strong> Technique if Indicated: </strong> If excessive secretions/meconium visible, gently suction mouth first, then nose. Use bulb suction or small suction catheter. Gentle technique. </li><li><strong> Avoid Over-suctioning: </strong> Only suction if baby cannot clear airway naturally. </li></ul><h4> Breathing Initiation </h4><ul><li><strong> Normal Onset: </strong> Breathing should begin within 30-60 seconds of delivery. First gasping breaths may be irregular. </li><li><strong> Color Progression: </strong> Initial cyanosis (blue-purple) in extremities is normal. Central body should pink within 1-2 minutes. Full body pinking by 5-10 minutes. </li><li><strong> Crying: </strong> Vigorous cry is excellent sign. Some newborns are quiet but breathing adequately. </li><li><strong> When to Intervene: </strong> No breathing by 1 minute, severe bradycardia, severe cyanosis, or gasping — begin resuscitation. </li></ul><h3> Apgar Scoring (1 and 5 minutes) </h3><p> Apgar score assesses newborn status at 1 minute and 5 minutes. Score from 0-10, derived from five signs: </p><table><thead><tr><th scope="col"> Sign </th><th scope="col"> 0 Points </th><th scope="col"> 1 Point </th><th scope="col"> 2 Points </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong> A - Appearance (Color) </strong></td><td> Pale/Blue </td><td> Body pink, extremities blue (acrocyanosis) </td><td> Completely pink </td></tr><tr><td><strong> P - Pulse (Heart Rate) </strong></td><td> Absent (<0) </td><td> Slow (< 100 bpm) </td><td> Vigorous (>100 bpm) </td></tr><tr><td><strong> G - Grimace (Reflex Irritability) </strong></td><td> No response </td><td> Grimace/weak cry </td><td> Vigorous cry </td></tr><tr><td><strong> A - Activity (Muscle Tone) </strong></td><td> Limp </td><td> Some flexion </td><td> Well flexed/active </td></tr><tr><td><strong> R - Respiration </strong></td><td> Absent </td><td> Slow/weak/irregular </td><td> Vigorous/crying </td></tr></tbody></table><div class="info-box"><h4> Apgar Score Interpretation </h4><ul style='margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 0;'><li> 7-10: Normal, no intervention needed </li><li> 4-6: Moderately depressed, stimulation and possible resuscitation </li><li> 0-3: Severely depressed, immediate resuscitation required </li></ul></div><h3> Breastfeeding Initiation </h3><p> Breastfeeding offers unparalleled benefits for both mother and newborn. Early initiation establishes supply and provides critical colostrum: </p><h4> Latch Within First Hour </h4><ul><li><strong> Timing: </strong> Most newborns are alert and ready in first 1-2 hours after birth. Missing this window often delays feeding. </li><li><strong> Positioning: </strong> Mother comfortable, newborn supported. Newborn's mouth should take in entire areola, not just nipple (areolar latch = more efficient milk transfer, less nipple trauma). </li><li><strong> Signs of Good Latch: </strong> Baby's chin touching breast, lips flanged outward, cheeks full and rounded during suckling, minimal pain for mother. </li><li><strong> Frequency: </strong> Newborns typically nurse 8-12 times in first 24 hours. Initial feedings may be brief (5-10 minutes each breast). </li></ul><h4> Colostrum: The First Milk </h4><ul><li><strong> Content: </strong> Produced in small quantities (15-40ml per feed) in first 3-5 days. Yellow, concentrated, thick consistency. </li><li><strong> Composition: </strong> High in protein, antibodies (IgA — protects intestinal mucosa), white blood cells, growth factors, vitamins A and E. Low in lactose, ideal for newborn digestion. </li><li><strong> Critical Benefits: </strong> Provides first antibodies, promotes beneficial gut bacteria colonization (prevents pathogenic bacteria overgrowth), stimulates meconium passage, prevents jaundice, provides all nutrition needed in first days. </li><li><strong> Myth Correction: </strong> Colostrum is NOT insufficient — it is perfectly suited for newborn's capacity and needs. </li></ul></section><section id="complications"><h2> 6. Obstetric Complications: When to Intervene </h2><p> While most pregnancies and labors progress normally, attendants must recognize complications requiring immediate intervention or transport to higher care. </p><h3> Breech Presentation </h3><p> Fetus presents buttocks or feet first instead of head. Occurs in 3-4% of term pregnancies. Management depends on breech type and provider experience: </p><h4> Breech Types </h4><div class="svg-container"><svg height="333" viewbox='0 0 600 400' width="500" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label='MIDWIFERY & PREGNANCY CARE diagram 2'><g><ellipse cx="100" cy="150" fill="#2c5282" opacity="0.3" rx="40" ry="50"></ellipse><circle cx="100" cy="100" fill="#e74c3c" opacity="0.5" r="25" stroke="#e74c3c" stroke-width="2"></circle><line stroke="#e0e0e0" stroke-width="2" x1="100" x2="100" y1="125" y2="175"></line><line stroke="#e0e0e0" stroke-width="2" x1="80" x2="70" y1="175" y2="220"></line><line stroke="#e0e0e0" stroke-width="2" x1="120" x2="130" y1="175" y2="220"></line><line stroke="#e0e0e0" stroke-width="2" x1="80" x2="50" y1="150" y2="140"></line><line stroke="#e0e0e0" stroke-width="2" x1="120" x2="150" y1="150" y2="140"></line><text fill="#e0e0e0" font-size="14" font-weight="bold" x="60" y="280"> Frank Breech </text><text fill="#bdc3c7" font-size="12" x="30" y="305"> Legs extended, feet up </text><text fill="#bdc3c7" font-size="12" x="30" y="320"> Buttocks present first </text></g><g><ellipse cx="300" cy="150" fill="#2c5282" opacity="0.3" rx="40" ry="50"></ellipse><circle cx="300" cy="100" fill="#e74c3c" opacity="0.5" r="25" stroke="#e74c3c" stroke-width="2"></circle><line stroke="#e0e0e0" stroke-width="2" x1="300" x2="300" y1="125" y2="175"></line><line stroke="#e0e0e0" stroke-width="2" x1="280" x2="270" y1="175" y2="220"></line><line stroke="#e0e0e0" stroke-width="2" x1="320" x2="330" y1="175" y2="220"></line><line stroke="#e0e0e0" stroke-width="2" x1="280" x2="250" y1="165" y2="200"></line><line stroke="#e0e0e0" stroke-width="2" x1="320" x2="350" y1="165" y2="200"></line><text fill="#e0e0e0" font-size="14" font-weight="bold" x="260" y="280"> Complete Breech </text><text fill="#bdc3c7" font-size="12" x="240" y="305"> Legs folded, knees bent </text><text fill="#bdc3c7" font-size="12" x="240" y="320"> Buttocks present first </text></g><g><ellipse cx="500" cy="150" fill="#2c5282" opacity="0.3" rx="40" ry="50"></ellipse><circle cx="500" cy="100" fill="#e74c3c" opacity="0.5" r="25" stroke="#e74c3c" stroke-width="2"></circle><line stroke="#e0e0e0" stroke-width="2" x1="500" x2="500" y1="125" y2="175"></line><line stroke="#e0e0e0" stroke-width="2" x1="480" x2="470" y1="175" y2="230"></line><line stroke="#e0e0e0" stroke-width="2" x1="520" x2="530" y1="175" y2="230"></line><line stroke="#e0e0e0" stroke-width="2" x1="480" x2="450" y1="150" y2="140"></line><line stroke="#e0e0e0" stroke-width="2" x1="520" x2="550" y1="150" y2="140"></line><circle cx="470" cy="235" fill="#f39c12" r="5"></circle><circle cx="530" cy="235" fill="#f39c12" r="5"></circle><text fill="#e0e0e0" font-size="14" font-weight="bold" x="460" y="280"> Footling Breech </text><text fill="#bdc3c7" font-size="12" x="440" y="305"> One or both feet present </text><text fill="#bdc3c7" font-size="12" x="440" y="320"> first (DANGEROUS) </text></g></svg><div class="svg-caption"> Breech Presentation Types: Frank (most common), Complete, and Footling (highest risk) </div></div><ul><li><strong> Frank Breech: </strong> Hips flexed, knees extended, feet up by head. Most common (65-70% of breech presentations). Best prognosis for vaginal delivery if experienced provider present and mother/pelvis suitable. </li><li><strong> Complete Breech: </strong> Both hips and knees flexed, feet up (sitting position). Approximately 30-35% of breech. Vaginal delivery possible if conditions favorable. </li><li><strong> Footling Breech (Incomplete): </strong> One or both feet present first. Most dangerous — cord prolapse risk, head entrapment risk. Typically requires cesarean delivery. </li></ul><h4> Vaginal Breech Delivery Requirements </h4><p> Only in specific circumstances should vaginal breech delivery be attempted: </p><ul><li> Frank or complete breech (not footling) </li><li> Estimated fetal weight 2500-4000 grams (5.5-8.8 lbs) </li><li> Mother's pelvis adequate (obstetric assessment required) </li><li> No hyperextension of fetal head on ultrasound </li><li> Experienced attendant present </li><li> Planned vaginal delivery, spontaneous labor, mother consents </li><li> Backup for cesarean available immediately </li></ul><h4> External Cephalic Version (ECV) </h4><p> If breech diagnosed weeks before due date, attempt to turn baby to head-down (vertex) position: </p><ul><li><strong> Timing: </strong> Best at 36-37 weeks. Success rate 40-60%. </li><li><strong> Contraindications: </strong> Previous uterine surgery, multiple pregnancy, abnormal fetal heart rate, placenta previa, vaginal bleeding, ROM (rupture of membranes). </li><li><strong> Procedure: </strong> Ultrasound assessment, tocolytic medications to relax uterus, gentle manual turning. Requires skilled provider. </li><li><strong> Complications: </strong> Rare but include ROM, placental abruption, premature labor. Benefits usually outweigh risks. </li></ul><h3> Umbilical Cord Prolapse </h3><p> A catastrophic emergency. The cord descends through the cervix before the baby, compressing against the baby's head and cutting off blood flow. </p><div class="danger-box"><h4> Cord Prolapse: Emergency Management </h4><ul><li><strong> Immediate Recognition: </strong> Visible cord protruding from vagina, often with gush of amniotic fluid, sudden severe deceleration on fetal monitoring. </li><li><strong> Do NOT Push: </strong> Mother must not push. Pushing compresses cord further against baby's head. </li><li><strong> Knee-Chest Position: </strong> Mother immediately assumes knee-chest position (knees down, chest to ground, bottom elevated) — uses gravity to reduce cord compression. </li><li><strong> Gentle Reposition: </strong> If cord is protruding from vagina and exposed to cool air, gently place back into vagina, supporting gently with warm cloth or gloved hand. Do not tie or clamp exposed cord. </li><li><strong> Continuous Monitoring: </strong> Keep fingers in vagina, gently supporting fetal head away from cord, maintaining knee-chest position. </li><li><strong> Transport Immediately: </strong> This requires immediate cesarean delivery. Transport to hospital while maintaining position and support. If hospital transport >30 minutes away and no cesarean available — have experienced provider prepare for emergency delivery attempt, though prognosis grave without cesarean. </li><li><strong> Prognosis: </strong> With immediate cesarean, most babies survive. Delays >30-60 minutes result in death or severe hypoxic injury. </li></ul></div><h3> Shoulder Dystocia </h3><p> After fetal head delivers, shoulders become stuck — true obstetric emergency.

Positions sacrum anteriorly, straightens sacral promontory. Perform immediately upon recognition. </li><li><strong> Suprapubic Pressure: </strong> Apply firm, downward pressure on top of baby's anterior shoulder (the one stuck behind pubic symphysis). Aim to dislodge shoulder under pubic bone. Do NOT apply fundal pressure (worsens impaction). </li><li><strong> Baby Rotation: </strong> Gently rotate baby's body. Internal rotation maneuvers (Rubin or Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit) by experienced providers may help. Avoid excessive traction (nerve injury risk). </li><li><strong> Position Changes: </strong> If first maneuvers unsuccessful, change mother's position — hands-and-knees or side-lying may help. </li><li><strong> Time Limit: </strong> If baby not delivered within 5-10 minutes, risk of hypoxic damage. Prepare for emergency cesarean if available and time permits. </li></ul><h3> Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH) </h3><p> Excessive bleeding after delivery. Defined as >500ml in vaginal delivery, >1000ml in cesarean. Life-threatening if >25% blood volume lost without replacement. </p><h4> Causes & Management </h4><ul><li><strong> Uterine Atony (90% of causes): </strong> Uterus fails to contract adequately, vessels remain open. Managed by uterine massage — rub uterine fundus firmly (feels like orange in abdomen) in circular motion. Stimulates contraction and hemostasis. Most critical intervention. </li><li><strong> Retained Placenta: </strong> Discussed in separate section below. </li><li><strong> Placental Abruption: </strong> Premature separation. Presentation: sudden bleeding during labor or early third stage. Management: quick delivery if not delivered yet, monitor for coagulopathy. </li><li><strong> Uterine Inversion: </strong> Uterus turns inside-out through cervix. Rare, catastrophic. Prevent by avoiding excessive cord traction or fundal pressure before placental separation. Management: stop all traction, gently reposition uterus, may need anesthesia. </li></ul><h4> PPH First-Line Treatment </h4><ul><li><strong> Uterine Massage: </strong> Immediately massage uterine fundus. Most effective intervention for atony. Continue for several minutes until uterus becomes firm. </li><li><strong> Oxytocin Administration (if available): </strong> 10 units IM, IV, or sublingual. Causes uterine contraction. Effect within minutes. Reduces bleeding significantly. </li><li><strong> Empty Bladder: </strong> Full bladder prevents uterine contraction. Catheterize if needed. </li><li><strong> IV Access & Fluids: </strong> Establish IV access, begin normal saline or Ringer's lactate rapidly. Replace blood volume. </li><li><strong> Bimanual Compression (if Bleeding Continues): </strong> Insert one hand into vagina, make fist, place against anterior uterine wall. Place other hand on abdomen behind uterus. Apply firm pressure, compressing uterus between hands. Extremely uncomfortable for mother but life-saving. Maintains until bleeding slows. </li><li><strong> Transport: </strong> If bleeding doesn't slow, transport to hospital for possible transfusion, suturing of tears, or uterine artery embolization. </li></ul><div class="warning-box"><h4> Signs of Shock from Blood Loss </h4><ul><li> Rapid heart rate >110 bpm </li><li> Rapid, shallow breathing </li><li> Low blood pressure <90/60 </li><li> Pale, clammy skin </li><li> Altered consciousness, confusion </li><li> Decreased urine output </li></ul></div></section><section id="preeclampsia"><h2> 7. Pre-eclampsia & Eclampsia: Recognition & Management </h2><p> Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy-specific multisystem disorder affecting 3-5% of pregnancies. Eclampsia (seizures) is the severe manifestation. Only cure is delivery of baby and placenta. </p><h3> Recognition of Pre-eclampsia </h3><h4> Diagnostic Criteria </h4><ul><li><strong> Hypertension: </strong> Blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg on two occasions at least 4 hours apart, or systolic ≥160 or diastolic ≥110 (severe range). OR increase of 30 mmHg systolic or 15 mmHg diastolic from baseline (if baseline known). </li><li><strong> Proteinuria: </strong> Protein in urine ≥1+ on dipstick, ≥300mg in 24-hour collection, or protein-to-creatinine ratio ≥0.3. Indicates glomerular injury. </li><li><strong> Edema: </strong> Swelling of face, hands, feet (but edema alone insufficient without hypertension/proteinuria). </li><li><strong> Symptomatology: </strong> Severe headache (especially frontal, unresponsive to analgesics), visual changes (scotomata, flashing lights, temporary blindness), right upper quadrant pain, severe epigastric pain, decreased urine output. </li></ul><h3> Eclampsia: Seizures & Emergency Management </h3><div class="danger-box"><h4> Eclamptic Seizures: Immediate Actions </h4><ul><li><strong> Protect Airway: </strong> Do NOT force objects into mouth (risk of tooth breakage, aspiration). Place in recovery position (on side) if seizure continues, to allow secretions to drain and maintain airway patency. </li><li><strong> Protect Head: </strong> Gentle support, prevent hitting hard objects. </li><li><strong> Time the Seizure: </strong> Note duration. If >5 minutes, give second dose of magnesium sulfate. </li><li><strong> Magnesium Sulfate (if available): </strong> Loading dose 4g IV over 5-10 minutes (or 10g IM given as 5g in each buttock), then maintenance 1g/hour IV until seizure stops and 12-24 hours after last seizure. Prevents recurrent seizures, reduces mortality significantly. Mechanism unknown but effective. </li><li><strong> Monitor Closely: </strong> Magnesium toxicity risk if renal function compromised. Monitor reflexes (diminished reflexes = toxicity early sign), urine output, respiratory rate. </li><li><strong> Delivery: </strong> Once mother stabilized, proceed with delivery (induction if intrapartum, cesarean if not in active labor). Delivery is only definitive cure. </li></ul></div><h3> Preventing & Managing Pre-eclampsia </h3><h4> Risk Factors </h4><ul><li> First pregnancy </li><li> Age <18 or >35 years </li><li> Hypertension (chronic or pregnancy-induced) </li><li> Obesity (BMI >30) </li><li> Diabetes (pre-gestational or gestational) </li><li> Multiple gestation </li><li> Renal disease </li><li> Autoimmune disease (lupus, antiphospholipid syndrome) </li></ul><h4> Management Without Magnesium Sulfate </h4><p> In low-resource settings without access to magnesium sulfate: </p><ul><li><strong> Blood Pressure Reduction: </strong> If BP >160/110, use antihypertensives (methyldopa, labetolol, nifedipine if available). </li><li><strong> Seizure Prevention: </strong> Anticonvulsants (phenytoin, diazepam) if magnesium unavailable. Phenytoin less effective than magnesium but better than nothing. </li><li><strong> Delivery Planning: </strong> Do not delay delivery. Arrange transport to facility with cesarean capability. </li><li><strong> Monitoring: </strong> Frequent assessment of vital signs, symptoms, reflexes, urine output. </li></ul><h3> Postpartum Pre-eclampsia <p> Pre-eclampsia can develop or worsen in first 72 hours postpartum (usually subsides within 6 weeks postpartum). Close monitoring essential in first week after delivery. </p></h3></section><section id="retained-placenta"><h2> 8. Retained Placenta: Diagnosis & Management </h2><p> The placenta should deliver within 30-60 minutes of baby's birth. Retention beyond 60 minutes increases hemorrhage risk and infection risk dramatically. </p><h3> Diagnosis of Retained Placenta </h3><ul><li><strong> Visible Signs: </strong> No placental tissue expelled, cord remains in vagina, no gush of blood with placental separation. </li><li><strong> Clinical Exam: </strong> Gentle assessment — can fingers reach placenta? Is it firmly adherent? </li><li><strong> Risk Factors: </strong> Placenta previa or accreta, uterine inversion, precipitous labor, uterine atony (paradoxically — weak contractions can't expel placenta). </li></ul><h3> Management of Retained Placenta </h3><h4> Active Management (First 30 Minutes) </h4><ul><li><strong> Controlled Cord Traction: </strong> Gently apply steady downward traction on cord while providing counter-pressure on uterine fundus (press upward on abdomen above uterus, just below umbilicus). This prevents uterine inversion. Gentle, steady traction — not jerky pulling. </li><li><strong> Oxytocin: </strong> If not already given, administer 10 units IM, IV, or sublingual to stimulate uterine contractions. Contractions may help separate placenta. </li><li><strong> Ambulation & Position Changes: </strong> Mother sitting upright, walking, squatting — gravity and position changes may help. </li><li><strong> Bladder Emptying: </strong> Full bladder prevents contraction. Ensure urination or catheterize. </li></ul><h4> If Retention >1 Hour: Manual Removal (Last Resort) </h4><div class="warning-box"><h4> Manual Placental Removal: High Risk Procedure </h4><p><strong> This is extremely painful and carries significant risks. Only perform if: </strong></p><ul><li> Placenta still retained beyond 60-90 minutes </li><li> Significant bleeding occurring or risk of shock </li><li> No access to hospital/surgery within reasonable time </li><li> Mother consents (after explanation of risks) </li><li> Provider has training/experience </li></ul><p><strong> Risks: </strong> Uterine perforation, severe infection/sepsis, retained placental fragments, coagulopathy, death. </p><p><strong> Procedure (in experienced hands): </strong></p><ul><li> Pain management: strong analgesia, local/regional if available </li><li> Asepsis: clean/sterile technique as possible </li><li> Insert gloved hand into uterus following cord </li><li> Gently separate placenta from uterine wall using side-to-side motion of hand </li><li> Once separated, gently withdraw placenta </li><li> After removal: uterine massage, oxytocin, antibiotic prophylaxis </li><li> Transport if fever develops — infection likely </li></ul></div><h3> Prevention of Retained Placenta </h3><ul><li> Active management of third stage (oxytocin, controlled cord traction) versus expectant management — debate continues. Active management reduces retention risk and PPH risk significantly. </li><li> Avoid aggressive cord traction before placental separation. </li><li> Ensure uterus is contracting (massage if atonic). </li></ul></section><section id="postpartum"><h2> 9. Postpartum Care: First Weeks Recovery </h2><p> The postpartum period is a time of dramatic physiologic change. The mother's body must return to non-pregnant state while healing perineal trauma and adjusting emotionally. </p><h3> Lochia: Normal Postpartum Bleeding </h3><p> Lochia is the normal vaginal discharge after delivery, containing blood, placental tissue, and endometrial cells: </p><ul><li><strong> Duration: </strong> Continues 2-6 weeks postpartum, typically longer after first pregnancy. </li><li><strong> Character Progression: </strong> First 3-5 days = bright red, heavy (soaking pads), contains clots. Then darkens to brown/pink, decreases in volume over 2 weeks. By week 3-4, yellowish/white. </li><li><strong> Normal Amount: </strong> First 3 days <500ml daily. Decreases significantly by week 2. </li><li><strong> Abnormal Signs: </strong> Excessive bleeding (soaking pad per hour), foul odor (infection sign), lack of progression (clots retained). </li></ul><h3> Perineal Care & Healing </h3><p> Most women experience some perineal trauma (tears or episiotomy). First-degree tears involve skin only, heal quickly. Second-degree involve skin and muscle, require more care. </p><h4> Perineal Trauma Management </h4><ul><li><strong> Ice Application: </strong> First 24-48 hours, ice packs to perineum reduce swelling and pain. Wrap ice in cloth, apply 20 minutes on, 20 minutes off. </li><li><strong> Sitz Baths: </strong> After first 24 hours, warm water sitz baths 3-4 times daily, especially after bowel movements. Warm water (not hot) promotes healing, reduces pain, aids cleansing. 10-15 minutes duration. </li><li><strong> Keep Clean: </strong> Change pads frequently, use "peri bottle" (squeeze bottle) to clean perineum after urination/defecation. </li><li><strong> Avoid Constipation: </strong> Stool softeners, hydration, fiber promote regular stools. Hard stools strain tears. </li><li><strong> Pain Management: </strong> Acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed. Topical anesthetics available in some settings. </li><li><strong> Sexual Activity: </strong> Avoid vaginal penetration until bleeding stops and pain-free (typically 4-6 weeks). Risk of infection if resumed too early. </li></ul><h3> Signs of Postpartum Infection </h3><div class="danger-box"><h4> Postpartum Infections: When to Seek Care </h4><ul><li><strong> Fever >101°F (38.3°C) </strong> — most common sign </li><li><strong> Foul-smelling lochia </strong> — indicates infection </li><li><strong> Increasing pain </strong> — especially in lower abdomen or perineum </li><li><strong> Chills, malaise </strong> — systemic infection signs </li><li><strong> Yellowish/purulent drainage </strong> from tears </li></ul><p><strong> Management: </strong> Antibiotic prophylaxis or treatment if infection confirmed. Supportive care. If severe/septic, hospitalization needed. </p></div><h3> Breast Engorgement </h3><p> Engorgement is normal on day 3-5 postpartum when milk comes in. Breasts become swollen, painful, hot. </p><ul><li><strong> Management: </strong> Frequent breastfeeding (8-12 times daily) is most effective treatment. Milk removal relieves engorgement. </li><li><strong> Cold Compresses: </strong> Between feedings, apply cold packs to reduce swelling. </li><li><strong> Supportive Bra: </strong> Comfortable support reduces pain. </li><li><strong> Pain Relief: </strong> Acetaminophen or ibuprofen before feeding. </li><li><strong> Duration: </strong> Usually resolves within 24-48 hours with frequent feeding. </li></ul><h3> Postpartum Depression & Mental Health </h3><p> Pregnancy and birth dramatically affect maternal mental health. Recognition and support are critical: </p><ul><li><strong> "Baby Blues" (50-80% of mothers): </strong> Mild sadness, crying, anxiety lasting days to weeks. Self-limited, usually resolves without treatment. Reassurance and support helpful. </li><li><strong> Postpartum Depression (10-20% of mothers): </strong> Persistent sadness, loss of interest, guilt, difficulty bonding, sleep disturbance (beyond normal postpartum wakefulness), poor appetite, difficulty concentrating. Onset can be weeks to months. Requires treatment — counseling, antidepressants, or both. </li><li><strong> Postpartum Psychosis (0.1-0.2%): </strong> Hallucinations, delusions, confusion, incoherence. Severe psychiatric emergency. Requires hospitalization and psychiatric care. </li><li><strong> Screening: </strong> Ask specifically about mood, sleep, bonding, anxiety. Use Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale if available (10-item questionnaire). </li><li><strong> Support: </strong> Allow expression of feelings without judgment. Connect with support groups. Discuss with partner/family. </li></ul><h3> Return of Menstruation </h3><ul><li><strong> Non-Breastfeeding: </strong> Menstruation typically returns 6-8 weeks postpartum. </li><li><strong> Breastfeeding: </strong> Lactational amenorrhea is common while exclusively breastfeeding. Returns 2-20 months postpartum depending on feeding frequency/duration. Unreliable for contraception — pregnancies occur despite amenorrhea. </li></ul><h3> Contraception Planning </h3><p> Discuss contraception before discharge or at 6-week visit. Options: </p><ul><li> Barrier methods (condoms) — safe immediately </li><li> Hormonal contraception (pills, patches, implants) — defer 6 weeks postpartum due to VTE (venous thromboembolism) risk </li><li> IUDs — can insert immediately postpartum </li><li> Lactational amenorrhea — unreliable alone </li><li> Natural family planning — requires education </li></ul></section><section id="newborn-first-week"><h2> 10. Newborn Care First Week: Critical Daily Monitoring </h2><p> The first week of life is critical. Daily assessment and teaching prevent serious complications and establish healthy patterns. </p><h3> Umbilical Cord Stump Care </h3><p> The umbilical cord stump requires attention until it separates (falls off) at 7-14 days: </p><ul><li><strong> Keep Dry: </strong> Most important. Cord falls off faster and infection risk lower when dry. Change diapers to avoid wetting stump. Expose to air when possible. </li><li><strong> Keep Clean: </strong> Wipe gently with cloth dampened in clean water if soiled with feces or urine. Pat dry thoroughly. </li><li><strong> Avoid Tight Clothing: </strong> Ensure diaper folded below umbilicus, clothing loose to allow air circulation. </li><li><strong> Cord Care Products: </strong> Antiseptic powder or liquid (if available) — studies mixed on benefit, but no harm. Traditional dry care equally effective. </li><li><strong> Expected Progress: </strong> Stump darkens, becomes wrinkled, gradually separates. Small amount of oozing normal at separation. </li><li><strong> Signs of Infection: </strong> Pus (not just clear oozing), foul odor, surrounding skin red/swollen/warm. Fever in baby. Requires antibiotic treatment. </li></ul><h3> Jaundice: Recognition & Management </h3><p> Jaundice (yellow skin/sclera) affects 50-60% of term newborns, usually benign. Develops by day 2-3, peaks day 4-5, resolves by 2-3 weeks. Caused by elevated bilirubin from increased red blood cell destruction. </p><h4> Physiologic vs Pathologic Jaundice </h4><ul><li><strong> Physiologic: </strong> Appears after 24 hours, peaks ~96 hours, resolves by 2 weeks. Usually bilirubin <17-18 mg/dL (varies by age/weight). Benign, requires monitoring but no treatment. </li><li><strong> Pathologic: </strong> Appears <24 hours after birth, rises rapidly, very high levels (>20 mg/dL). Associated with hemolytic disease, infection, or other pathology. Requires evaluation and treatment. </li></ul><h4> Management of Jaundice </h4><ul><li><strong> Phototherapy (if available): </strong> Expose baby to special blue light that converts bilirubin to form easily excreted by body. Place under light (bilirubin phototherapy unit) with eyes protected, naked. Phototherapy thresholds vary by age in hours and risk factors. </li><li><strong> Sunlight Exposure (if no phototherapy available): </strong> Place baby undressed in direct sunlight 15-30 minutes, 2-3 times daily. Effective but less predictable than phototherapy. Risk of overheating — monitor temperature and don't overheat. </li><li><strong> Feeding (Most Important): </strong> Frequent breastfeeding (10-12 times daily) stimulates bowel movements, promoting bilirubin excretion. If breastfeeding struggling, supplement with expressed breast milk or formula to ensure adequate intake. </li><li><strong> Monitoring: </strong> If bilirubin very high (>25 mg/dL), risk of kernicterus (bilirubin encephalopathy) causing permanent brain damage. Requires exchange transfusion (removing baby's blood and replacing with donor blood) — severe procedure, reserved for extreme cases. </li></ul><h4> Danger Signs of Severe Jaundice </h4><div class="danger-box"><h4> Kernicterus Warning Signs </h4><ul><li> Lethargy, difficult to rouse </li><li> Poor feeding, weak suck </li><li> Hypotonia (floppy) or hypertonia (stiff) </li><li> High-pitched cry </li><li> Seizures, convulsions </li></ul><p> If any present with very high bilirubin, emergency transport to hospital for exchange transfusion may be lifesaving. </p></div><h3> Newborn Feeding: First Week </h3><h4> Breastfeeding Establishment </h4><ul><li><strong> Frequency: </strong> Minimum 8-12 times in first 24 hours, every 2-3 hours. Frequent feeding stimulates milk production and ensures adequate nutrition. </li><li><strong> Duration: </strong> Allow baby to feed until satisfied. Typically 10-20 minutes per side, but duration highly variable. Two-sided feeding ensures both breasts stimulated. </li><li><strong> Signs of Adequate Feeding: </strong> Baby appears satisfied after feeding, mother feels breasts soften, baby has wet diapers (5-6 by day 5), stools (meconium to green by day 3, yellow by day 5). </li><li><strong> Latch:** Revisit positioning if any pain or concerns. Well-latched baby has entire areola in mouth, cheeks not dimpled, no clicking sounds. </strong></li></ul><h4> Formula Feeding (if needed) </h4><ul><li><strong> Frequency: </strong> Every 2-3 hours. Newborns take 15-30ml per feeding, increasing to 60-90ml by end of first week. </li><li><strong> Preparation: </strong> Use clean water, sterilized bottles/nipples if possible. Follow formula instructions carefully. </li><li><strong> Overfeeding Risk: </strong> Newborns have small stomach capacity — offer amounts appropriate to age/weight, not forced feeding. </li></ul><h3> Newborn Weight Changes </h3><p> Weight loss is normal in first days due to fluid loss and minimal intake. Significant gain indicates adequate nutrition: </p><ul><li><strong> Expected Weight Loss: </strong> 5-10% of birth weight lost by day 3-4 (more common in breastfed babies, less in formula-fed). Regained by 10-14 days of age. </li><li><strong> Excessive Loss: </strong> Loss >10% or failure to regain by 2 weeks suggests feeding problem. Intervention needed — improve latch, supplement with expressed milk/formula, or formula supplementation. </li><li><strong> Monitoring: </strong> Daily weighing first week identifies problems early. </li></ul><h3> Stool & Urine Patterns </h3><p> Normal bowel and urinary patterns confirm adequate feeding and rule out obstruction: </p><ul><li><strong> Meconium (First Stools): </strong> Black, tarry, sticky stools (day 1-2). Result of swallowing amniotic fluid and vernix during gestation. </li><li><strong> Transition Stools (Day 3-4): </strong> Change from black to brown to greenish as breastfeeding/formula feeding begins. Mix of meconium and milk stools. </li><li><strong> Mature Milk Stools (Day 5 onward): </strong> Yellow, loose consistency in breastfed babies ("seedy"). Tan/brown and thicker in formula-fed babies. </li><li><strong> Stool Frequency: </strong> Minimum 3-4 stools daily by day 3-5 in breastfed babies. At least 1-2 in formula-fed babies. </li><li><strong> Urination: </strong> First void within 24 hours. 6+ wet diapers daily by day 5-6 indicates adequate fluid intake. </li><li><strong> Delayed Meconium Passage: </strong> If no meconium by 48 hours, rule out obstruction (Hirschsprung disease, meconium ileus). Exam needed. </li></ul><h3> Sleeping & Alertness Patterns </h3><ul><li><strong> Normal Sleep: </strong> Newborns sleep 16-17 hours daily in first week, in short bursts (3-4 hours at most). Sleep interrupted by feeding hunger. </li><li><strong> Alertness: </strong> Periods of quiet alertness (eyes open, not crying) are important for bonding. Usually shortly after feeding. </li><li><strong> Excessive Sleepiness: </strong> If difficult to rouse or feeds poorly, investigate — jaundice, infection, other illness. </li><li><strong> Excessive Crying: </strong> Purple crying (colicky) peaks at 2-4 weeks. Before week 1, excessive crying warrants evaluation for pain/discomfort (hunger, diaper soiling, temperature). </li></ul><h3> Daily Newborn Examination Checklist </h3><p> Daily assessment prevents complications: </p><ul><li> Temperature, heart rate, breathing rate </li><li> Color, jaundice assessment </li><li> Feeding adequacy (latch, output) </li><li> Umbilical stump (dry, intact, no discharge) </li><li> Skin integrity, rashes, infection signs </li><li> Eyes, ears, nose, mouth examination </li><li> Abdomen (soft, no distension, bowel sounds present) </li><li> Neurologic assessment (reflexes, tone, alertness) </li><li> Maternal well-being and support needs </li></ul><h3> When to Seek Urgent Care </h3><div class="danger-box"><h4> Newborn Danger Signs (First Week) </h4><ul><li> Temperature >38.5°C (101.3°F) rectally or <36.5°C (97.7°F) </li><li> Difficulty breathing, grunting, flaring nostrils, retractions </li><li> Lethargy, not rousing for feeding </li><li> Refusal to feed or weak suck </li><li> Seizures, convulsions </li><li> Severe jaundice (bilirubin >20 mg/dL) with lethargy </li><li> Excessive bleeding from umbilical stump (not just oozing) </li><li> Signs of umbilical infection (pus, foul odor, surrounding redness/warmth) </li><li> Abdominal distension, not passing stool by 48 hours with poor feeding </li><li> Excessive crying beyond normal </li></ul></div></section><div class="related-guides"><h3> Related Guides </h3><ul><li><a href="medical-reference.html"> Medical Reference & Anatomy </a></li><li><a href="surgery-field.html"> Surgery & Field Medicine </a></li><li><a href="herbalism.html"> Herbalism & Medicinal Plants </a></li><li><a href="home-management.html"> Home Management & Family Care </a></li></ul></div></main><div class="common-mistakes"><h3> Common Mistakes </h3><ul><li> Add specific common mistakes here based on the guide content </li></ul></div><div class="notes-section"><div class="notes-header"><span> My Notes </span><span class="notes-toggle"> ▼ </span></div><div class="notes-content"><textarea class="notes-textarea" id="guide-notes-text" placeholder='Add your personal notes here.
