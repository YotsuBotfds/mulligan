Simple designs can be constructed from wood and rope.</p><h3>Backstrap Loom (Most Portable):</h3><p>Simplest loom design: two wooden bars, one attached to fixed structure, other to weaver's waist via strap. Space between bars creates weaving width (typically 30-60cm). Suitable for narrow fabrics (belts, trim) or larger cloths in sections. Minimal materials needed; portable for traveling weavers.</p><h3>Frame Loom (Most Practical):</h3><ol><li><strong>Build frame:</strong> Assemble sturdy wooden frame (4x1 meter typical) with cross-supports every 30cm</li><li><strong>Warp bars:</strong> Two horizontal bars at top and bottom of frame, 3cm diameter hardwood</li><li><strong>Create tension:</strong> Drill holes through frame uprights; insert wedges to adjust warp tension</li><li><strong>Warp path:</strong> Wrap cordage around front/back of warp bars, creating 40-80 warp threads at even spacing (1-2cm apart)</li><li><strong>Shed sticks:</strong> Insert smooth hardwood stick perpendicular to warp (separates threads for easy shuttle passage)</li></ol><h3>Upright Loom (Vertical, Large-Scale):</h3><p>Tall wooden frame (1.5-2m height) with horizontal warp bars top and bottom. Used for wide fabrics and tapestries. More complex setup but produces full-size cloth (2-3 meters wide possible). Typical in medieval and traditional textile production.</p></section><section id="warping"><h2>Warping & Setup</h2><h3>Warp Preparation:</h3><ol><li><strong>Calculate length:</strong> Cloth length + 20cm extra for tension adjustment + 10cm for waste</li><li><strong>Measure yarn:</strong> Use measuring device (pegs or frame) to ensure uniform warp length</li><li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Mark warp bar at 1-2cm intervals (guides thread placement)</li><li><strong>Threading:</strong> Insert warps from side to side, keeping even tension throughout</li><li><strong>Tension:</strong> Properly tensioned warp should have slight resistance when pressed (not slack, not overly tight)</li></ol><h3>Heddle Creation (Weaver's Shortcut):</h3><p>Create heddle bar: wooden rod with loops of cordage attached (one loop per warp thread). Heddle bar lifts alternate warps, creating automatic shed (separation) when raised. Eliminates manual thread lifting for every pass.</p><h3>Shed Stick:</h3><p>Insert flat stick perpendicular to warps. Creates natural division: threads above stick alternate with threads below when stick is rotated.</p></section><section id="plain-weave"><h2>Plain Weave Basics</h2><p>Simplest and most fundamental weave: weft passes over and under alternating warp threads. All other weaves variations of this principle.</p><h3>Weaving Process:</h3><ol><li><strong>Create shed:</strong> Raise heddle (or lift alternate warps manually), creating opening for shuttle</li><li><strong>Pass shuttle:</strong> Pass weft through shed from left to right</li><li><strong>Beat:</strong> Use sword (flat stick) to press weft against previously woven fabric</li><li><strong>Reverse shed:</strong> Lower heddle (or lift different warps), creating opposite shed</li><li><strong>Return pass:</strong> Pass shuttle right to left through new shed</li><li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Continue for desired cloth length (60-100 passes per minute typical rate)</li></ol><h3>Tension & Consistency:</h3><p>Uniform tension produces even cloth. Loose tension creates loose fabric; tight tension creates dense fabric. Tension maintained by beating (tightening weft) and keeping warp stretch consistent. Experienced weavers produce cloth with minimal tension variation.</p><h3>Finishing Weft:</h3><p>Change color/yarn thickness intentionally for visual interest. Stripes easily created by changing weft color every 5-10 passes. Pattern emerges from color changes and weaving variations.</p></section><section id="advanced-weaves"><h2>Advanced Weave Patterns</h2><h3>Twill Weave:</h3><p>Weft passes over 2+ warp threads instead of 1. Creates diagonal line pattern. Common variation: 2-over-2-under produces 45-degree diagonals. Twill is stronger than plain weave (superior fabric for clothing and wear). More complex threading but produces superior cloth.</p><h3>Satin Weave:</h3><p>Float (passes over multiple warps without interlacing). Example: weft over 4 warps, under 1. Creates smooth, lustrous surface. Requires 4-8 harnesses (manual control possible but complex). Satin weaves are delicate (loose floats catch and snag) but produce beautiful cloth.</p><h3>Tapestry Weave:</h3><p>Weft is thicker than warp; weft completely covers warp in final fabric. Used for pictorial designs (pattern created by changing weft colors). Labor-intensive but produces image-bearing cloth. Decorative rather than functional.</p><h3>Basket Weave:</h3><p>Multiple threads woven as one unit (2-2 basket: pairs of warp and weft). Creates checkered appearance. Balanced weave produces square fabric units.</p></section><section id="dyes"><h2>Natural Dyes</h2><p>Survival context emphasizes natural dyes from available plants. Traditional dyes produce colors varied by mordant (chemical fixative) and dye plant used.</p><h3>Common Natural Dyes:</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Dye Plant</th><th scope="row">Color</th><th scope="row">Mordant</th><th scope="row">Notes</th></tr><tr><td>Madder Root</td><td>Red/Orange</td><td>Alum</td><td>Most reliable; requires 1+ year root aging</td></tr><tr><td>Weld (dyer's yellow)</td><td>Bright Yellow</td><td>Alum</td><td>Traditional yellow dye; thorough dyeing needed</td></tr><tr><td>Woad</td><td>Blue</td><td>Ferrous sulfate</td><td>Fermentation process required; complex dye chemistry</td></tr><tr><td>Indigo</td><td>Deep Blue</td><td>Complex process</td><td>Tropical plant; difficult in temperate zones</td></tr><tr><td>Walnut Hulls</td><td>Brown/Black</td><td>Iron</td><td>Readily available; effective dye</td></tr><tr><td>Oak Gall</td><td>Black</td><td>Iron</td><td>Very dark color; traditional textile dye</td></tr></table><h3>Dyeing Process (Cold Dye):</h3><ol><li><strong>Prepare dye bath:</strong> Simmer dye plant material 1-2 hours; strain to collect liquid</li><li><strong>Mordant yarn:</strong> Soak yarn in mordant solution (alum, tannin, or iron) for 30 minutes to 1 hour</li><li><strong>Dye:</strong> Add pre-mordanted yarn to dye bath; simmer gently 30-60 minutes</li><li><strong>Cool:</strong> Allow yarn to cool in dye bath (improves color absorption)</li><li><strong>Rinse:</strong> Rinse in cool water until water runs clear</li><li><strong>Dry:</strong> Hang to dry; color develops fully after drying</li></ol><h3>Color Variation Techniques:</h3><ul><li><strong>Different mordants:</strong> Same dye + alum produces yellow, alum + tannin produces brown, alum + iron produces greenish</li><li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Hotter dye bath produces darker color; cooler bath lighter shade</li><li><strong>Dye concentration:</strong> More plant material produces deeper color</li><li><strong>Layering:</strong> Dye same yarn in two different dyes sequentially for new colors (yellow + blue = green)</li></ul></section><section id="finishing"><h2>Finishing Techniques</h2><h3>Washing:</h3><p>First washing removes dust and excess dye. Use cool water with mild soap (soap made from guides above). Gentle agitation only—avoid rough handling. Dry flat or hanging to maintain shape.</p><h3>Fulling (Felting):</h3><p>Hot water + agitation causes fibers to entangle and lock together. Creates denser, warmer fabric. Suitable for wool and animal fibers; not effective on plant fibers. Process: alternate hot water soaking and gentle wringing, 5-10 cycles until desired density achieved.</p><h3>Calendering (Smoothing):</h3><p>Press fabric between heavy boards or with hot iron (traditional: heated stones). Creates smooth, glossy surface. Temporary effect on plant fibers (fades with washing). Useful for special occasions or fine cloth.</p><h3>Napping:</h3><p>Brush fabric surface to raise fibers. Creates soft, fuzzy surface. Done after fulling. Use coarse brush or carded brush and stroke in one direction (up the nap). Provides insulation and visual interest.</p></section><section id="fabric-types"><h2>Fabric Types & Uses</h2><h3>Linen (Flax Fiber):</h3><p>Crisp, cool to touch, durable, strong when wet (improves with washing). Ideal for: hot climates, clothing, table linens. Plain weave most common. Medium difficulty to weave; requires consistent tension.</p><h3>Wool (Sheep Fiber):</h3><p>Warm, felts easily, resilient, absorbs moisture while maintaining warmth. Ideal for: cold climates, blankets, outer clothing. Twill and plain weaves common. Relatively easy to weave; fiber properties forgiving of tension variation.</p><h3>Cotton (Seed Fiber):</h3><p>Soft, absorbent, durable, reasonably easy to grow in warm climates. Ideal for: warm climates, underwear, general clothing. Requires ginning (separation from seed) before spinning. Plain and twill weaves common.</p><h3>Nettle/Bast Fibers:</h3><p>Strong, fine, historically used for fine linen. Labor-intensive to process (retting required). Results in exceptional durability and sheen. Requires skilled spinning and weaving.</p></section><section id="common-mistakes"><h2>Common Mistakes & Solutions</h2><h3>Mistake 1: Uneven Warp Tension</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Some warp threads slack, others tight. Results: cloth is uneven width, selvedges wavy, tension difficult to manage.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Check tension before weaving begins. Adjust individual warps as needed. Maintain consistent beat (pressure when closing shed) to preserve tension during weaving.</p><h3>Mistake 2: Skipping Warps or Threading Errors</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Missing warp threads during warping or threading shuttles incorrectly. Results in holes or distortion in finished cloth.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Double-check warp count before beginning. Verify shuttle path each pass. For large projects, mark loom every 10cm for thread count verification.</p><h3>Mistake 3: Improper Dye Mordant Preparation</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Insufficient mordant or wrong chemical causes dye to wash out quickly or colors to remain dull.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Measure mordant precisely. Allow adequate soaking time (1+ hours). Use recommended mordants for each dye plant.</p><h3>Mistake 4: Over-Beating</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Pressing weft too tightly, creating dense cloth that becomes stiff and brittle.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Beat with gentle, consistent pressure. Feel fabric as it develops—proper beat produces cloth with balanced density and drape.</p></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="cra-03-cordage-textiles.html">Cordage Making</a><a href="cra-04-soap-making.html">Soap Making (for Washing)</a><a href="waterproofing-textiles.html">Waterproofing Methods</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
