Selection depends on hazard type.</p><h3>PPE Categories</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Equipment<th scope="row">Protection<th scope="row">When Required<th scope="row">Notes<tr><td>Gloves (Nitrile)<td>Hand chemical burn, absorption<td>All chemical handling<td>Double-glove for caustics, replace if punctured<tr><td>Gloves (Latex)<td>Organic solvents<td>Toluene, xylene exposure<td>Nitrile resistant to many organics, latex to others - test compatibility<tr><td>Gloves (Neoprene)<td>Strong acids, bases<td>Sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide<td>Thicker (0.75mm+), superior chemical resistance<tr><td>Face Shield<td>Eye/face splash<td>Liquid handling <90°C<td>Clear polycarbonate, worn over goggles<tr><td>Safety Goggles<td>Eye protection<td>All chemical work (mandatory)<td>Direct ventilation type for liquids, indirect for gases<tr><td>Respirator (N95)<td>Dust particles<td>Powder/dust generation<td>Not effective for toxic gases - chemical cartridges needed<tr><td>Respirator (P100+cartridge)<td>Toxic gases, acid mist<td>H₂S, SO₂, HCl vapor, chlorine<td>Must fit-test; use supplied-air for >1000 ppm<tr><td>Lab Coat<td>Skin/clothing protection<td>All chemistry work<td>100% cotton preferred (synthetic melts from heat)<tr><td>Closed Shoes<td>Foot protection<td>All work areas<td>Leather recommended (plastic dissolves in some solvents)<tr><td>Hair Restraint<td>Prevent entanglement<td>Open flame, rotating equipment<td>Simple ponytail or cap sufficient</table><h3>Respirator Selection</h3><p>Incorrect respirator use provides false security. Test fit: (1) don negative-pressure mask, (2) cover inlet with hand, (3) inhale - mask should collapse inward if fit is good. Replace filter immediately if you smell chemical through mask (cartridge saturated or improper seal). Filters effective 6-8 hours of use; replace sooner with high concentrations. Do not share respirators - fit varies by face.</p><p>Chemical cartridge color coding: Yellow = organic vapors, Blue = acid gases, Green = ammonia, Purple = mercury, Red = formaldehyde, Gray = specific chemicals. Use correct type - wrong cartridge offers no protection.</p></section><section id="storage"><h2>Storage Compatibility Charts</h2><p>Incompatible chemicals stored together react spontaneously, releasing heat, toxic gases, or explosions. Segregation saves lives and prevents property loss.</p><h3>Critical Incompatibilities</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Group A<th scope="row">Group B<th scope="row">Reaction/Hazard<th scope="row">Storage Rule<tr><td>Sulfuric Acid<td>Water (cold)<td>Violent boiling, spattering<td>Add acid to water, never reversed; 5m separation<tr><td>Sulfuric Acid<td>Oxidizers (nitric acid, peroxide)<td>Explosive decomposition<td>Separate shelves, different rooms<tr><td>Sodium Hydroxide<td>Acids (any)<td>Violent neutralization heat release<td>Minimum 5m separation<tr><td>Hydrogen Peroxide<td>Organics, metals<td>Exothermic decomposition<td>Store in cool, dark location separate<tr><td>Chlorine gas<td>Ammonia, hydrogen<td>Toxic chloramine gas, explosion<td>Never store in same room<tr><td>Alkali metals (Na, K)<td>Water, alcohols, acids<td>Explosive ignition, hydrogen gas<td>Store under mineral oil in sealed container<tr><td>Phosphorus (white)<td>Heat, oxygen<td>Spontaneous ignition<td>Store under water in sealed glass bottle<tr><td>Acetylene<td>Copper/brass<td>Explosive acetylide formation<td>Use steel/iron/aluminum lines only<tr><td>Peroxide<td>Heavy metals (Fe, Cu, Mn)<td>Decomposition acceleration<td>Separate by location<tr><td>Ammonia<td>Halogens (Cl₂, Br₂)<td>Exothermic, gas generation<td>Separate storage areas</table><h3>Segregation Methods</h3><p><strong>Physical separation:</strong> Incompatible groups stored 5+ meters apart, different shelves. This is minimum - greater distance is safer. For large quantities (industrial), separate buildings preferable.</p><p><strong>Secondary containment:</strong> All corrosive/reactive chemicals stored in acid-resistant trays or cabinets. Tray capacity ≥110% of largest container volume. Purpose: contained spill prevents mixing with other stored chemicals. Examples: fiberglass trays for acids/bases, steel trays for most organics.</p><p><strong>Atmospheric control:</strong> Volatile chemicals stored in sealed, ventilated cabinets. Vapor escape prevented. Ventilation directed outdoors, not recirculated. Temperature controlled <25°C for stability.</p></section><section id="spill"><h2>Spill Response Procedures</h2><p>Immediate response to chemical spill prevents escalation and protects people and equipment.</p><h3>Emergency Action Plan</h3><ol><li><strong>Alert:</strong> Announce spill loudly - "Chemical spill!". Stop work in area. Activate alarms if available<li><strong>Evacuate:</strong> Non-essential personnel leave area (100m upwind from toxic gases). Close doors but do not lock. Allow response team entry<li><strong>Assess:</strong> Identify chemical (read label), estimate quantity, type (liquid/powder), area affected<li><strong>Contain:</strong> Prevent spread: (a) liquid - construct dike with sand/absorbent, (b) powder - lightly spray water (avoid dustiness), (c) vapor - increase ventilation, move heavier-than-air gas downwind<li><strong>Neutralize:</strong> Use appropriate agent (acid spill → soda ash or limestone, base spill → vinegar or mild acid). Never add water directly to strong acids<li><strong>Absorb:</strong> Use diatomaceous earth, sand, oil absorbent, or specialized spill kit. Do not use sawdust for strong acids (wood softens, fluid spreads)<li><strong>Dispose:</strong> Sweep/shovel into labeled hazardous waste container. Seal and mark clearly. Do not pour down drain - contaminates water supply<li><strong>Decontaminate:</strong> Wash area with water and detergent. Rinse thoroughly. Air dry or wipe with paper towels</ol><h3>Spill Kit Components</h3><ul><li>Absorbent (30L): diatomaceous earth, specialized polymer (faster absorption)<li>Neutralizers: soda ash (20kg), limestone (10kg), vinegar (5L)<li>Equipment: shovel, broom, dustpan, brush, tongs, protective gear (extra gloves/goggles)<li>Bags: heavy plastic, labeled "Hazmat - Chemical Waste"<li>Documentation: log sheet, eye wash bottle (1L min), emergency number poster</ul><p>Kits should be located throughout work area, readily accessible. Inspect monthly, replace used items promptly.</p><div class="warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Do NOT attempt to neutralize chemicals you cannot identify. When unsure, flood with water (dilution strategy), construct secondary containment, and call emergency services. Some chemicals (like reactive metals, concentrated acids) react dangerously with common neutralizers. When in doubt, containment > treatment.</div></section><section id="disposal"><h2>Safe Disposal Methods</h2><p>Improper chemical disposal contaminates groundwater, harms wildlife, and violates environmental law. Proper disposal methods vary by chemical class.</p><h3>Disposal by Chemical Type</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Chemical Class<th scope="row">Safe Disposal Method<th scope="row">Acceptable Sites<th scope="row">Avoid<tr><td>Acids (dilute <10%)<td>Neutralize with limestone, drain to sewer<td>Municipal treatment plant<td>Direct water bodies, soil infiltration<tr><td>Acids (concentrated >10%)<td>Hazardous waste facility pickup<td>Licensed hazmat contractor<td>Any uncontrolled disposal<tr><td>Bases (dilute <10%)<td>Neutralize with vinegar/weak acid, drain<td>Municipal treatment<td>Water infiltration untreated<tr><td>Heavy metals (salts)<td>Precipitate as hydroxide, landfill<td>Hazmat facility<td>Water systems - bioaccumulation<tr><td>Organics (solvents)<td>Hazmat facility (incineration)<td>Licensed contractor<td>Evaporation (air pollution), soil<tr><td>Oxidizers (peroxide, perchlorate)<td>Reduce to salt, then treat as salt<td>Hazmat facility<td>Landfill without treatment (leaching)<tr><td>Reactive metals (Na, K, P white)<td>Specialized incineration (high temp)<td>Licensed hazmat only<td>Any uncontrolled - fire risk<tr><td>Flammable waste<td>Incineration at authorized facility<td>Licensed contractor<td>Landfill (leaching), open burning</table><h3>DIY Neutralization (Limited)</h3><p>Only for small quantities of simple chemicals:</p><p><strong>Dilute acids:</strong> Slowly add limestone powder (CaCO₃) or soda ash (Na₂CO₃) to acid until pH paper reaches 6-8 (neutral). Stir continuously. Allow heat to dissipate. Once neutral, can drain to sewer if local regulations permit.</p><p><strong>Dilute bases:</strong> Slowly add vinegar (5% acetic acid) or dilute hydrochloric acid. Stir and monitor pH. Keep pH 6-8 range. Drain once neutral.</p><p><strong>Heavy metal solutions:</strong> Add lime to precipitate as hydroxide (M²⁺ + Ca(OH)₂ → M(OH)₂↓ + Ca²⁺). Filter solids, dry, and landfill. Liquid (now clean) can be drained after neutralization.</p><p>When in doubt, contact local hazardous waste facility for collection - usually free for small quantities and ensures compliance.</p></section><section id="antidotes"><h2>Antidote and First Aid Table</h2><table><tr><th scope="row">Poison<th scope="row">Exposure Route<th scope="row">Acute Symptoms<th scope="row">First Aid<th scope="row">Antidote (if available)<tr><td>Cyanide salts<td>Ingestion, inhalation<td>Headache, dizziness, respiratory distress, seizure, death<td>Move to fresh air, CPR if needed, call emergency<td>Amyl nitrite (breaks cyanide-enzyme bond), hydroxocobalamin IV<tr><td>Heavy metals (Pb, Hg, As)<td>Inhalation, ingestion, skin<td>Tremors, neuropathy, organ damage, progressive<td>Remove from exposure, supportive care<td>Chelation therapy (EDTA, DMSA) - medical only<tr><td>Organophosphates<td>Skin, inhalation<td>Excessive salivation, pupil contraction, muscle twitching, paralysis<td>Move to air, remove clothing, wash skin/hair thoroughly<td>Atropine (reverses some effects), pralidoxime<tr><td>Corrosive acids<td>Ingestion<td>Mouth/throat burning, vomiting blood, shock<td>Rinse mouth with water, do NOT induce vomiting, fluid replacement<td>None - supportive care only<tr><td>Corrosive bases<td>Ingestion<td>Mouth/throat burning, vomiting, internal bleeding<td>Rinse mouth, do NOT induce vomiting, medical care urgent<td>None - supportive care only<tr><td>Methanol/ethylene glycol<td>Ingestion<td>CNS depression, metabolic acidosis, blindness (methanol)<td>Activate charcoal if <1 hour, hospital transport urgent<td>Ethanol (competes metabolism), hemodialysis<tr><td>Carbon monoxide<td>Inhalation<td>Headache, confusion, unconsciousness, death<td>Move to fresh air, oxygen therapy if available, CPR<td>High-flow oxygen (accelerates CO elimination)<tr><td>Hydrogen sulfide<td>Inhalation<td>Eye irritation, respiratory distress, cardiac arrest<td>Fresh air, oxygen, CPR, call emergency<td>Nitrite therapy (similar to cyanide)</table></section><section id="chemical-exposure"><h2>Chemical Exposure Treatment</h2><h3>Inhalation Exposure</h3><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> (1) Move person to fresh air immediately - do not re-enter contaminated area without protection, (2) loosen tight clothing, (3) Position lying down with head elevated slightly, (4) if conscious, have them breathe slowly and deeply, (5) if unconscious, turn head to side (recovery position) and monitor breathing, (6) provide oxygen if available (8-15 L/min), (7) call emergency services, (8) monitor for delayed respiratory distress (can occur hours later with some chemicals like chlorine).</p><p>Mild irritation (coughing, eye watering): Fresh air, rest, cool compress on eyes. Monitor for progression. Seek medical care if symptoms persist >1 hour.</p><h3>Skin Exposure</h3><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> (1) Remove contaminated clothing immediately (cut away if stuck, do not pull roughly), (2) flush affected area with copious water for 15 minutes minimum - more for strong acids/bases, (3) use mild soap and water to wash, (4) do NOT rub - gently rinse, (5) dry with clean cloth, (6) do NOT apply ointments/salves (can trap chemical), (7) cover burn loosely with clean dry cloth, (8) seek medical care if area >4cm or blistering develops.</p><p>Special cases: (a) phenol (carbolic acid) - decontamination with ethanol better than water (phenol water-soluble but water-accelerated penetration), (b) white phosphorus - keep submerged in water or mineral oil (prevent oxidation/ignition), (c) hydrofluoric acid - calcium gluconate treatment critical (HF penetrates deeply, leaches calcium from bones causing fatal cardiac arrhythmias - seek emergency care immediately).</p><h3>Eye Exposure</h3><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> (1) rinse immediately and continuously for 15 minutes with water or saline, (2) use eye wash station if available, (3) hold eyelid open to ensure irrigation of full eye surface, (4) do NOT rub eye, (5) remove contact lenses if present, (6) after rinsing, apply loose dry bandage, (7) seek immediate medical care (all chemical eye injuries need professional evaluation - risk of scarring/blindness).</p><h3>Ingestion Exposure</h3><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> (1) Call poison control immediately - have container/label ready, (2) if conscious and swallowing intact, rinse mouth with water, (3) do NOT induce vomiting unless advised by poison control (vomiting corrosive chemicals causes additional damage), (4) activated charcoal 1g/kg body weight in water if instructed and <1 hour post-ingestion, (5) if unconscious/seizing, position on side and monitor breathing, (6) transport to emergency department with chemical container (informs treatment). Bring container label - critical for poison control and medical team.</p></section><section id="emergency"><h2>Emergency Procedures</h2><h3>Major Release / Fire</h3><p><strong>If chemical fire:</strong> (1) evacuate immediately - do not attempt extinguish unless trained and protected, (2) activate fire alarm, (3) leave fire extinguisher to trained personnel (some chemicals burning require specific extinguishing agents - water wrong for some, CO₂ wrong for others), (4) close doors behind you to contain spread, (5) assemble downwind at safe distance (>100m), (6) call fire department with chemical identification, (7) await professional response.</p><p><strong>If large vapor release (toxic gas):</strong> (1) evacuate immediately upwind, (2) close all windows/doors, (3) call emergency services with chemical name, (4) do not allow re-entry until authorities clear area, (5) activate building ventilation if accessible without risk.</p><h3>Emergency Contact Information</h3><p>Post in all work areas:</p><ul><li>Poison Control: (varies by country) - US: 1-800-222-1222<li>Fire/Medical: 911 (US) or equivalent<li>Hazmat Response: Local environmental agency<li>Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) location - keep physical copies and digital backup accessible</ul><h3>Documentation</h3><p>Maintain incident log: date, time, chemical, exposure route, affected person(s), symptoms, treatment provided, outcome. Critical for medical follow-up and legal liability. Review incidents for prevention improvements - most accidents preventable through procedure changes.</p><div class="warning"><strong>Critical:</strong> Chemical emergencies escalate rapidly. When in doubt, call emergency services. Modern medicine saves lives from chemical injuries; delays turn treatable exposures into fatalities.
