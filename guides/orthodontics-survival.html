Wire is bent to correct tooth position; tension guides teeth into alignment. Bands (rings cemented to molars) provide additional anchorage. Components: brackets, archwires (various materials/sizes), ligatures (ties holding wire to bracket), bands, elastics/rubbers. In survival: if patient has braces, manage complications; removal requires professional care.</p><h3>Removable Appliances</h3><p>Dentures, retainers, aligners. Can be removed by patient. Advantage in survival: patient can remove for cleaning, eating, emergency situations. Disadvantage: effectiveness depends on compliance (wearing as prescribed).</p><h3>Appliance Failure Points</h3><p>Brackets: adhesive failure (bond breaks), bracket crack/breakage. Wires: breakage, kinking, unbending. Bands: cement failure, band slippage. Elastics: degradation, loss. Survival scenario: minimize damage, improvise temporary solutions, accept some discomfort for time period until professional care available.</p></section><section id=wire-management><h2>Wire Management</h2><h3>Wire Breakage</h3><p>Signs: visible wire break (usually midway along wire), increased discomfort, loss of tooth control. Causes: trauma, material fatigue, corrosion. Management: remove wire segment (if possible without damaging tooth/bracket). Improvise temporary replacement: flexible wire (guitar string, fishing line, thin metal wire if available) threaded through brackets to maintain some position control. Apply topical anesthetic if sharp wire causing irritation.</p><h3>Protruding Wire</h3><p>Sharp wire end extends beyond bracket, irritates lip/cheek. Management: 1) Identify protrusion point (ask patient, visually confirm). 2) Protective covering: apply wax (if available) or soft material to cover sharp end. 3) Bend back: if safe, gently bend wire back with pliers (if tool available) to eliminate protrusion. 4) Accept temporary irritation if bending impossible; topical treatments (anesthetic, lip balm) provide comfort.</p><h3>Loose/Unbent Wire</h3><p>Wire slips out of brackets, loses tension (no longer applies force). Management: rethread wire through brackets if possible, reactivate (rebend) to position. If cannot accomplish: maintain with temporary wire to prevent complete loss of position control. Remove wire entirely if completely non-functional (patient may tolerate better than sharp irritation).</p></section><section id=bracket-repair><h2>Bracket and Band Repair</h2><h3>Bonded Bracket Failure</h3><p>Bracket separates from tooth surface; adhesive fails. Signs: bracket loose but still attached by wire, bracket visible space from tooth, bracket pain when chewing. Causes: inadequate initial bonding, high shear forces, decay under bracket. Management: 1) Do NOT force removal (damages tooth). 2) Stabilize with temporary wire if mobility high. 3) If causing pain: consider extraction of tooth (if acceptable in survival), or accept temporary discomfort. 4) Seek professional re-bonding when possible.</p><h3>Bracket Breakage</h3><p>Bracket physically breaks (crack, missing piece, slot damaged). Signs: bracket damage visible, wire won't stay secure, sharp fragment if broken piece present. Management: remove sharp debris (if loose), stabilize remaining bracket with wire, wrap tooth/bracket area if sharp edges cutting mouth tissue. May need extraction if bracket severely damaged and patient in pain.</p><h3>Band Looseness</h3><p>Molar band (cemented ring) loosens; cement fails. Signs: band mobility, sometimes food trapping underneath, possible sensitivity. Management: avoid sticky foods, use floss carefully to avoid dislodging further. If band completely loose: remove and rinse/dry tooth (prevents decay under band). If band stays in place: apply temporary cement (zinc oxide eugenol) to reseat if bond loose. Professional re-cementation needed long-term.</p></section><section id=pain-management><h2>Pain Management</h2><h3>Pressure Soreness (Normal with Adjustment)</h3><p>After initial placement or wire tightening: teeth ache, tender to chewing. Usually resolves in 3-5 days. Management: NSAIDs (ibuprofen 400-600mg every 4-6 hours), soft foods, warm salt water rinses, topical anesthetic rinses if available. Wax over brackets if irritating soft tissue.</p><h3>Ulceration from Irritation</h3><p>Sharp wire/bracket rubs creating open sore on lip/cheek/tongue. Management: 1) Identify sharp component (bend back or cover). 2) Topical treatment: anesthetic ointment (benzocaine), antimicrobial if available (chlorhexidine rinse), honey (natural antibacterial). 3) Protective covering: beeswax, soft wax, or improvised soft material over sharp edge. 4) Avoid irritating foods/beverages. 5) Warm salt water rinses (1/2 teaspoon salt per 8 oz water) promote healing.</p><h3>Severe Pain</h3><p>Possible causes: bracket/wire pressing on exposed dentin, abscess (dental infection), root exposure. Management: NSAIDs, topical anesthetic, assessment for infection (check for abscess signs: swelling, fever, increased pain). If infection suspected: antibiotics, possible extraction. If exposed dentin: apply desensitizing paste (if available), avoid acidic foods.</p></section><section id=emergency-procedures><h2>Emergency Procedures</h2><h3>Bracket Removal</h3><p>If bracket causing severe pain/damage and cannot be managed conservatively: removal necessary. Method: 1) Gentle pressure with instrument to dislodge adhesive (do NOT pry aggressively—risks enamel fracture). 2) Once separated: scrape off remaining adhesive with plastic instrument. 3) Polish enamel to smooth. 4) Risk: residual adhesive roughness (may need professional polish later), but preserves tooth integrity for future re-bonding.</p><h3>Wire Removal Entirely</h3><p>If wire cannot be managed: remove completely. Method: 1) Cut wire segments between brackets (use wire cutter if available, or file through). 2) Remove segments carefully. 3) Clean remaining adhesive/wire from brackets. 4) Accept loss of orthodontic correction temporarily; will need professional replacement post-survival.</p><h3>Extraction if Necessary</h3><p>If tooth with bracket/appliance causing intolerable pain, mobility excessive, or infection present: extraction may be only option. Post-extraction: appliance on surrounding teeth will be affected; redistribute force/remove if necessary. Accept that orthodontic treatment disrupted; focus on infection/pain control.</p></section><section id=hygiene><h2>Oral Hygiene with Appliances</h2><h3>Cleaning Around Brackets</h3><p>Braces trap food/plaque. Inadequate cleaning → rapid decay. Technique: 1) Brush: use soft brush, angle 45° toward gum, small circular motions around bracket. 2) Floss: specialized floss threader or waxed floss passed between teeth/bracket. 3) Water irrigator (if available) flushes debris. 4) In survival: maintain best possible cleaning (brush after meals, improvise floss from cloth if needed).</p><h3>Plaque Accumulation Risk</h3><p>Orthodontic patients high-risk for cavities if hygiene poor. In survival with limited toothpaste: use whatever available (sea salt paste, baking soda paste, improvise). Rinse frequently with salt water. If plaque accumulation heavy: accept increased cavity risk; prevention focus where possible.</p><h3>Periodontal Complications</h3><p>Gum disease (gingivitis, periodontitis) more common with braces (mechanical irritation, difficult cleaning). Signs: red/swollen gums, bleeding with brushing, recession. Management: improve hygiene, anti-inflammatory rinses (salt water), floss around braces. If periodontal infection develops: treat with antibiotics, possible appliance removal if infection severe.</p></section><section id=complications><h2>Common Complications</h2><h3>Allergic Reactions</h3><p>Nickel (in some wires/brackets) causes allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. Symptoms: red rash in/around mouth, local swelling, itching. Management: remove/replace offending appliance component if possible (use stainless steel alternative if available), antihistamines (diphenhydramine 25-50mg), topical corticosteroid cream if available. If severe reaction: remove appliance temporarily.</p><h3>Appliance Damage from Trauma</h3><p>Sports injury, fall, blow to mouth: brackets/wire may break, teeth displace. Management: assess for tooth fracture/displacement (see first aid), stabilize appliance if functional, replace broken components if possible. Accept temporary derangement; focus on tooth/oral tissue integrity.</p><h3>Decay Under Appliance</h3><p>Brackets/bands harbor bacteria; poor cleaning → cavities form. Signs: white spots (demineralization) around brackets, visible cavity, pain. Management: improved hygiene going forward, topical fluoride rinse if available, accept cavity and address once appliance removed. Prevention: maintain meticulous cleaning during orthodontia.</p></section><section id=safety><div class=warning><h3>Critical Orthodontic Safety</h3><ul><li>Sharp wire = laceration risk. Never leave protruding sharp wire untreated; cover or bend back immediately.<li>Swallowed bracket/wire = choking/GI injury risk. Ensure small components secured; if swallowed, monitor for symptoms (abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing); seek professional evaluation if symptoms develop.<li>Infection around appliance = rapid spread risk. Treat infections aggressively with antibiotics; swelling with fever indicates systemic infection risk.<li>Pressure necrosis from tight appliance = possible enamel/root damage. Adjust tension if patient reports escalating pain; do not continue increasing force blindly.</ul></div></section><section id=mistakes><div class=mistakes><h3>Common Orthodontic Care Errors</h3><ul><li><strong>Aggressive bracket removal:</strong> Damages enamel. Use gentle pressure, patience, avoid prying.<li><strong>Wire tension over-tightening:</strong> Excessive force causes pain, root resorption, necrosis. Adjust cautiously; patient discomfort guides limits.<li><strong>Ignoring infection signs:</strong> Swelling, fever, pain = infection. Treat with antibiotics, assess for abscess drainage.<li><strong>Poor hygiene acceptance:</strong> Assume brushing/flossing will be done; it often isn't. Educate, monitor, provide tools if possible.</ul></div></section><div class=related role="navigation" aria-label="Related guides"><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href=anatomy-oral.html>Oral Anatomy</a> • <a href=dentistry-restorative.html>Restorative Dentistry</a> • <a href=first-aid.html>First Aid</a> • <a href=infection-control.html>Infection Control</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
