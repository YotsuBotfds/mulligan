Diagnosis: throat culture, rapid antigen test. Treatment: penicillin V 500mg 4x daily x 10 days, or cephalexin if available. Complications: rheumatic fever (joint/heart damage), post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (kidney). Prophylactic penicillin for rheumatic fever history prevents recurrence.</p><h3>Staphylococcal Infections</h3><p><strong>S. aureus:</strong> Common skin/soft tissue infections (boils, cellulitis, abscesses), pneumonia, sepsis. MRSA (methicillin-resistant) common in healthcare settings. Diagnosis: culture from infected site, gram stain (grape-cluster arrangement). Treatment: cephalexin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, or vancomycin (MRSA). Abscess = drainage priority; incision and drainage often necessary before antibiotics effective. Watch for necrotizing fasciitis (rapidly spreading, severe pain)—surgical emergency.</p><h3>Pneumonia</h3><p><strong>Bacterial pneumonia:</strong> Fever, cough (productive), chest pain, dyspnea, confusion. Streptococcus pneumoniae common. Diagnosis: chest X-ray (consolidation pattern), sputum culture. Treatment: amoxicillin, azithromycin, or fluoroquinolone. Supportive care: fluids, rest, temperature management. Complications: sepsis, empyema (fluid collection), lung abscess. Severe pneumonia = medical emergency requiring evacuation if possible.</p><h3>Urinary Tract Infections (UTI)</h3><p>Dysuria (pain on urination), frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain. E. coli most common. Diagnosis: urinalysis (pyuria, bacteriuria), urine culture. Treatment: TMP-SMX, nitrofurantoin, fluoroquinolone x 3-7 days. Pyelonephritis (kidney infection): fever, flank pain, nausea. Requires longer antibiotic course (10-14 days) ± hospitalization. Adequate hydration important.</p><h3>Gastrointestinal Infections</h3><p>Bacterial gastroenteritis: diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fever. Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter common. Usually self-limited (3-7 days). Management: hydration (oral rehydration solution critical), bland diet, rest. Antibiotics not routinely recommended (may prolong carrier state), but indicated for severe infection or immunocompromised. Preventive: hand hygiene, food safety, boiled water.</p></section><section id="viral"><h2>Viral Infections</h2><h3>Influenza (Flu)</h3><p>Fever, myalgia, cough, malaise, usually abrupt onset. Highly contagious droplet transmission. Diagnosis: rapid antigen test if available, clinical presentation. Treatment: supportive (hydration, rest, temperature management), antivirals if available (oseltamivir) within 48 hours onset (reduces duration/severity). Complications: secondary bacterial pneumonia, bronchitis, myocarditis. Vaccine if available, prioritize vulnerable (elderly, chronic disease, pregnancy).</p><h3>Common Cold (Rhinovirus)</h3><p>Mild symptoms: runny nose, sore throat, mild cough, low/no fever. Usually self-limited (3-7 days). Management: supportive (fluids, rest), symptom relief. Secondary bacterial infection can occur. No specific antiviral. Prevention: hand hygiene, avoid respiratory secretion contact, isolation during acute phase.</p><h3>Measles (Rubeola)</h3><p><strong>Highly contagious</strong> (R0 ~15; one person infects 15 others if unvaccinated). 3Cs + rash progression: Cough, Coryza (runny nose), Conjunctivitis + maculopapular rash starting face, spreading downward. Fever high (104°F+ possible). Koplik spots (white spots inside mouth) pathognomonic. Diagnosis: clinical; PCR, serology if available. Treatment: supportive only; no antivirals. Complications: pneumonia, encephalitis (1/1000, high mortality), subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE, fatal). Vitamin A supplementation reduces mortality. Isolation: 4 days after rash onset. Post-exposure prophylaxis: MMR vaccine within 72 hours prevents/lessens disease in contacts.</p><h3>Chickenpox (Varicella-Zoster Virus)</h3><p>Fever, malaise, then vesicular rash (crops, all stages present simultaneously). Usually self-limited in healthy children. Diagnosis: clinical appearance, PCR if needed. Treatment: supportive; antivirals (acyclovir) if started within 24 hours lessens severity. High-risk groups (adults, immunocompromised, pregnancy): require antivirals. Complications: secondary bacterial infection, pneumonia, encephalitis, disseminated disease. Isolation: until all lesions crusted over (typically 7-10 days). Post-exposure: varicella vaccine within 3-5 days effective in preventing/modifying disease.</p><h3>COVID-19</h3><p>Respiratory illness ranging asymptomatic to severe pneumonia. Fever, cough, dyspnea, loss of taste/smell common. Highly variable presentation. Diagnosis: molecular test (PCR, gold standard), antigen test (rapid, less sensitive), antibody test. Treatment: supportive care, oxygen if hypoxic, antivirals if available (remdesivir, paxlovid). Complications: severe pneumonia, thromboembolism, multi-organ failure in severe cases. Prevention: vaccination, masking (N95 for wearer protection, surgical for source control), isolation, ventilation.</p></section><section id="fungal"><h2>Fungal Infections</h2><h3>Candidiasis (Oral Thrush)</h3><p>White patches on tongue/palate, erythema, difficulty swallowing, altered taste. Common in immunocompromised (HIV, antibiotics), diabetes. Diagnosis: clinical, KOH preparation shows pseudohyphae. Treatment: nystatin suspension (rinse and swallow), clotrimazole lozenges, or fluconazole if severe. Prevention: good oral hygiene, treat underlying causes, avoid prolonged antibiotics if possible.</p><h3>Tinea (Fungal Skin Infection)</h3><p>Ring worm (tinea corporis): red, circular lesions with raised edges, central clearing. Tinea pedis (athlete's foot): scaling, itching between toes. Tinea unguium (nail): discoloration, thickening, crumbling. Diagnosis: clinical, KOH prep, culture if needed. Treatment: topical antifungal creams (terbinafine, miconazole) for localized; oral terbinafine/fluconazole for nail/severe infection. Prevention: keep dry, use powder, avoid communal bathing if possible.</p><h3>Histoplasmosis</h3><p>Inhalation from soil/bird droppings. Acute: fever, cough, chest pain (may resemble pneumonia). Chronic progressive: pulmonary infiltrates, cavitation. Diagnosis: serology, urine antigen, culture (slow). Treatment: itraconazole or amphotericin B (severe). Risk factors: cave exploration, bird/bat exposure, immunocompromised. Prevention: avoid dust from contaminated soil/droppings.</p></section><section id="parasitic"><h2>Parasitic Infections</h2><h3>Malaria</h3><p><strong>Plasmodium</strong> parasites transmitted by mosquito. Fever (often cyclical—every 48-72 hours depending on species), chills, malaise, headache. Symptoms may present 1-4 weeks post-exposure. Diagnosis: blood smear microscopy (parasites in RBCs), rapid antigen test. Treatment: artemisinin-based combination therapy (artemether-lumefantrine) preferred, or chloroquine if Plasmodium malariae/ovale, or quinine if pregnant. Severe malaria = cerebral malaria, acute kidney injury, pulmonary edema—life-threatening. Prevention: insect repellent (DEET), nets, clothing coverage, chemoprophylaxis if available.</p><h3>Hookworms</h3><p>Larval penetration of skin from contaminated soil. Symptoms: itching (ground itch), abdominal pain, diarrhea, anemia (chronic). Diagnosis: stool examination (eggs). Treatment: albendazole or mebendazole. Prevention: footwear, sanitation.</p><h3>Giardiasis</h3><p>Waterborne protozoan infection. Diarrhea (often watery, greasy), abdominal cramps, bloating, weight loss. Diagnosis: stool examination, antigen detection. Treatment: tinidazole or metronidazole. Prevention: safe water (boiling/filtering), sanitation.</p><h3>Schistosomiasis</h3><p>Waterborne parasite (cercariae penetrate skin). Acute: rash, fever, myalgia. Chronic: diarrhea, abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly, hematuria (S. haematobium). Diagnosis: stool examination, serology. Treatment: praziquantel. Prevention: avoid contaminated water, treat sewage.</p></section><section id="quarantine"><h2>Quarantine and Isolation Protocols</h2><h3>Quarantine vs Isolation</h3><p><strong>Quarantine:</strong> Separate exposed but not yet symptomatic persons to prevent spread. Duration: 5-14 days depending on disease (follows incubation period). <strong>Isolation:</strong> Separate symptomatic/confirmed infected to prevent transmission. Duration: varies by disease and symptom resolution.</p><h3>Common Quarantine/Isolation Periods</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Disease<th scope="row">Quarantine<th scope="row">Isolation<th scope="row">Notes<tr><td>COVID-19<td>5 days after exposure<td>5 days after symptom onset (if asymptomatic, 5 days from positive test)<td>Vaccinated/previously infected: shorter if available<tr><td>Measles<td>21 days from last exposure<td>4 days after rash onset<td>No quarantine if documented immunity<tr><td>Chickenpox<td>21 days (if not immune)<td>Until all lesions crusted<td>Vaccination within 72 hours prevents/modifies<tr><td>TB<td>Not applicable (not contagious pre-symptom)<td>Until improved on treatment (usually 2+ weeks)<td>Requires respiratory isolation<tr><td>Influenza<td>7 days or 24 hrs symptom-free (if confirmed)<td>At least 5 days or until fever-free 24 hrs<td></table><h3>Quarantine Logistics in Survival Scenario</h3><p>Establish separate shelter area if possible (even tent separated by distance). Provide food, water, supplies without contact. Use dedicated equipment. Daily symptom monitoring (temperature, new symptoms). If symptoms develop, transition to isolation. If quarantine ends without symptoms, return to normal activities.</p></section><section id="outbreak"><h2>Outbreak Management</h2><h3>Outbreak Recognition</h3><p>Increase in cases above baseline: more cases than expected for time/place/population. Identify common features: location, time, exposure, symptoms, severity. Investigate systematically: interview cases, identify source, assess transmission. Calculate attack rate (cases/exposed population). Early recognition allows rapid response.</p><h3>Case Investigation</h3><ul><li>Confirm diagnosis (clinical, lab if available)<li>Identify contacts (household, workplace, shared events)<li>Document symptom onset, duration, severity, complications<li>Identify risk factors (age, underlying conditions, vaccination status)<li>Determine potential source (recent travel, known exposures, food/water)<li>Note duration of communicability to assess quarantine needs</ul><h3>Contact Tracing</h3><p>Identify all individuals exposed during communicable period. Provide information about quarantine, symptom monitoring, testing. Daily check-ins if possible. Isolate immediately if symptoms develop. Testing contacts (if available) identifies secondary cases earlier. Challenge in survival scenario: limited communication methods, may not have contact information.</p><h3>Source Control</h3><p>Find the source and prevent further transmission: food safety investigation if foodborne, water source if waterborne, environmental assessment for vectors (mosquitoes, ticks). Implement control measures: discard contaminated food, treat water, vector control, quarantine/isolation of infected individuals.</p></section><section id="pandemic"><h2>Pandemic Response</h2><h3>Pandemic Phases</h3><ul><li><strong>Surveillance:</strong> Monitor cases in distant area; prepare stockpiles, plans<li><strong>Containment:</strong> Cases identified locally; aggressive isolation, quarantine, testing<li><strong>Community spread:</strong> Cannot trace source; reduce disease spread (masking, distancing), protect vulnerable<li><strong>Peak phase:</strong> Highest infection/death rates; healthcare system overwhelmed, focus shifts to managing severe cases only<li><strong>Decline:</strong> Cases decreasing; maintain precautions, identify vulnerable for targeted protection<li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Cases minimal; return to normal operations while maintaining surveillance</ul><h3>Pandemic Preparedness</h3><p><strong>Stockpiles:</strong> N95 masks, surgical masks, gloves, gowns, hand sanitizer, disinfectants, medications (antibiotics for secondary infections), oxygen equipment if possible, vaccines (if available). <strong>Planning:</strong> Establish communication protocols, allocate resources, define high-priority groups (healthcare workers, vulnerable), identify quarantine locations, establish supply distribution system. <strong>Community education:</strong> Provide accurate information, counter misinformation, teach hygiene, promote vaccination.</p><h3>Healthcare System Overwhelm</h3><p>During peak: hospitals full, staff exhausted, supplies depleted. Triage becomes critical (who receives limited resources). Surge capacity: use alternative facilities (schools, gymnasiums), cross-train staff, modify standard care (some patients not hospitalized). Difficult decision-making: allocate ventilators, oxygen, ICU beds based on likelihood of benefit and resource availability. Psychological support for healthcare workers essential.</p><h3>Vulnerable Population Protection</h3><p>Elderly (>65), chronic disease (diabetes, heart, lung, immune), pregnant, obesity at higher risk. Special protections: isolation from general population, dedicated healthcare workers (if possible), testing priority, treatment priority, vaccination priority. Emotional support: loneliness during prolonged isolation significant; scheduled contact, entertainment, communication with family critical.</p></section><section id="safety"><div class="warning"><h3>Critical Disease Management Warnings</h3><ul><li>Sepsis recognition = fever + two of: altered mental status, systemic inflammatory response (HR >90, RR >20, temp >38 or <36°C). Immediate antibiotics and fluid resuscitation critical; death can occur within hours if untreated.<li>Meningitis = fever + neck stiffness + altered consciousness = medical emergency. Suspect meningococcal: consider prophylactic antibiotics for contacts even before confirmation.<li>Hemorrhagic fever (Ebola, dengue hemorrhagic): uncontrolled bleeding, shock, multiorgan failure. Isolation critical; extremely high transmission risk. Supportive care only; vaccines/antivirals limited.<li>Antibiotic resistance = some pathogens resistant to common antibiotics (MRSA, VRE). Limits treatment options; appropriate stewardship critical to preserve effectiveness.</ul></div></section><section id="mistakes"><div class="mistakes"><h3>Common Disease Management Errors</h3><ul><li><strong>Incomplete antibiotic courses:</strong> Stopping early when symptoms improve allows relapse and resistance; complete full course<li><strong>Wrong antibiotic choice:</strong> Using antibiotic ineffective against pathogen delays recovery; culture and sensitivity guides choice<li><strong>Missed complications:</strong> Assuming uncomplicated illness; monitor for progression to severe (pneumonia→sepsis, UTI→pyelonephritis)<li><strong>Inadequate isolation:</strong> Early disease recognition and isolation crucial; delayed isolation allows spread<li><strong>Failure to investigate outbreak source:</strong> Without identifying source, control measures ineffective; systematic investigation essential</ul></div></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="infection-control.html">Infection Control</a> • <a href="medications.html">Essential Medications</a> • <a href="zoonotic-disease.html">Zoonotic Diseases</a> • <a href="toxicology.html">Toxicology</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
