While rain-fed farming works in select climates with consistent, well-distributed precipitation, most regions of the world face seasonal droughts, uneven rainfall, or insufficient annual precipitation to support agriculture at meaningful yields. Supplemental irrigation is not a luxury—it is the foundation of food security. </p><p> The benefits of irrigation are quantifiable and profound. Fields with supplemental water typically yield <span class="highlight"> 2 to 3 times </span> the production of rain-fed agriculture in the same region. A region that produces subsistence-level crops under rainfall alone can become a grain surplus exporter with irrigation. Irrigation transforms marginal land into productive farmland, enables year-round cultivation instead of a single season, and allows farmers to choose optimal planting times rather than gambling on rainfall. </p><p> Historically, the rise and fall of civilizations correlates directly with water management capacity. The Nile, Tigris, Euphrates, Indus, and Yellow River valleys produced the great empires of antiquity because they had river systems and societies organized enough to build irrigation infrastructure. When that infrastructure failed—due to war, drought, sediment accumulation, or abandonment—civilizations collapsed. Modern agriculture, feeding 8 billion people, depends entirely on irrigation systems ranging from simple gravity-fed furrows to massive dammed reservoirs. </p><div class="stat-box"><div class="number"> 70% </div><div class="label"> of global freshwater withdrawals go to agriculture </div></div><div class="stat-box"><div class="number"> 2–3× </div><div class="label"> yield increase with supplemental irrigation </div></div></section><section id="water-sources"><h2> 2. Water Sources </h2><p> Before you can irrigate, you must secure a reliable water source. Every context—climate, topography, geology, water availability—shapes which sources are viable. The art of water procurement is often the difference between thriving and starving. </p><h3> Rivers and Streams </h3><p> Rivers are the most reliable water source where available. Their advantage: water is already in motion, and you need only divert it to your fields. The simplest diversion is a <span class="highlight"> weir </span> (a low dam across the river) that raises water level enough to flow into a canal by gravity. More complex systems include: </p><ul><li><strong> Intakes: </strong> Submerged openings with screens to exclude debris and fish. </li><li><strong> Settling basins: </strong> Allow sediment to drop before water enters main canal, reducing clogging. </li><li><strong> Gates and sluices: </strong> Control flow volume and direction. </li></ul><p> Seasonal variation is the challenge. A river robust in spring flood may be a trickle by late summer. Large-scale river irrigation requires a <span class="highlight"> reservoir </span> (dam) to store flood water for use during dry season. </p><h3> Springs </h3><p> Springs are natural discharge points where groundwater emerges at the surface. They are reliable, often year-round, and require no pumping. A spring emerging at the base of a hillside can gravity-feed an entire terrace system below. Springs produce lower volumes than rivers but with remarkable consistency. Protect the spring head from contamination; a simple stone box around the emergence point, with an outlet pipe downslope, preserves water quality and allows gravity delivery. </p><h3> Wells </h3><p> Wells tap groundwater reserves. Depth varies dramatically—from 10 feet in alluvial plains to 300+ feet in arid regions. Groundwater is renewable (supplied by rainfall infiltration) but at rates slower than surface runoff; over-pumping a well depletes it. For detailed well-drilling techniques, see <strong> well-drilling.html </strong> . </p><p> Shallow hand-dug wells (10–30 feet) require minimal technology. Deep wells need drilling rigs and pumps. In contexts without machinery, a <span class="highlight"> treadle pump </span> (foot-operated suction pump) can lift water from depths to 25 feet, making shallow wells practical for irrigation. </p><h3> Ponds and Reservoirs </h3><p> Constructing a pond captures seasonal runoff. A basic pond is built by: </p><ul><li><strong> Site selection: </strong> A natural depression or low point in drainage, where runoff naturally concentrates. </li><li><strong> Clay seal: </strong> Layer the basin with compacted clay (2–3 feet minimum) to prevent seepage. In regions with clay soil, excavate and compact in place. In sandy regions, truck in clay. </li><li><strong> Dam embankment: </strong> Build an earth dam across the downslope side of the depression, sized for the catchment volume. Compact in layers; slope the upstream face 2:1 (2 feet horizontal per 1 foot rise) and downstream face 2.5:1 for stability. </li><li><strong> Spillway: </strong> Cut a wide, shallow overflow channel at one end, sized to handle the worst-case storm runoff without damaging the dam. </li></ul><p> A well-built pond lasts decades and provides water for irrigation, livestock, and household use. In monsoon regions, a 100-foot diameter × 10-foot deep pond can capture enough water to irrigate 5–10 acres through the dry season. </p><h3> Rainwater Harvesting </h3><p> Every water molecule falling on your roof is harvesting opportunity. The formula is simple: </p><div class="formula-box"> Collection (gallons) = Roof Area (sq ft) × Rainfall (inches) × 0.623 </div><p> One inch of rain falling on a 1,000-square-foot roof yields approximately <span class="highlight"> 623 gallons </span> . A 2,000-square-foot roof captures 1,246 gallons per inch of rain. Over a year with 20 inches of rainfall, a home roof collects over 12,000 gallons—enough for a substantial garden. </p><p> Roof water is collected via gutters into tanks (plastic, concrete, or cisterns). Basic system: gutters → downspout → first-flush diverter (diverts first dirty runoff) → storage tank → garden. First flush is crucial; the first 100 gallons of rainfall wash roof debris. A simple diverter is a 4-inch-diameter PVC tube with a floating ball; when full, it blocks the inlet, forcing fresh water into tanks. </p><div class="card"><div class="card-title"> Rainwater Harvesting Example </div><p> A household with 2,500 sq ft of roof area in a region receiving 30 inches of rain per year can harvest: 2,500 × 30 × 0.623 = 46,725 gallons annually. Stored in 5 × 2,000-gallon tanks, this is sufficient to irrigate a half-acre market garden through a three-month dry season (with drip irrigation). </p></div></section><section id="flood-basin"><h2> 3. Flood/Basin Irrigation </h2><p> Flood irrigation is the oldest and most straightforward method—simply divert water into a level field and let it spread. This method dominates in rice paddies worldwide and is practical for orchards, some field crops, and pasture. Its advantages: minimal infrastructure, simple operation, good for puddling rice paddies. Its drawback: water loss to evaporation and seepage, and the requirement for level land or significant earthmoving. </p><h3> Basic Methodology </h3><p> The process is elementary: </p><ol><li><strong> Water supply: </strong> A canal delivers water to the field perimeter. </li><li><strong> Leveling: </strong> The field (or paddies within a field) is graded flat within a few inches. For rice, this is critical; water depth must be uniform. </li><li><strong> Containment: </strong> Build berms (low earth embankments) around field edges to confine water. Height: typically 1–2 feet, depending on desired water depth and soil type. </li><li><strong> Filling: </strong> Open a gate or breach in the supply canal, and water flows into the field under gravity. Large fields may have multiple inlets. </li><li><strong> Holding: </strong> Water is held 1–6 inches deep (depending on crop) for the required duration (days to weeks). </li><li><strong> Draining: </strong> Close the inlet; water drains through the field naturally or is pumped out via a drain ditch. </li></ol><h3> Field Preparation for Flood Irrigation </h3><p> Success depends on precise leveling. For rice paddies (where water depth uniformity is critical), land is leveled to within 2 inches over large areas. Laser-guided leveling equipment is modern; historically, water itself was used as a reference—fill the field with water and scrape high spots until the surface is level. </p><p> In undulating terrain, terracing creates level platforms (see Section 6). Without terracing, flood irrigation works only on naturally flat land or with significant earthmoving. </p><h3> Berms and Levees </h3><p> Berms must be sturdy enough to hold water pressure without seeping or breaking. Construction: </p><ul><li> Excavate a trench along the perimeter 1 foot deep, 3 feet wide. </li><li> Compact the original soil in layers (6-inch lifts), tamping each layer. </li><li> Build the berm 2 feet high (measured from original grade), maintaining a 2:1 slope on both sides. </li><li> If soil is sandy, add clay (20–30% of volume) and mix in, to reduce seepage. </li><li> Seed the berm surface with grass or clover; vegetation prevents erosion and allows foot traffic. </li></ul><p> Internal field ditches (called <span class="highlight"> check dikes </span> ) subdivide large fields, allowing staged filling and more uniform distribution. In a 10-acre rice paddy, check dikes spaced every 50–100 feet prevent water from ponding in one area while another remains dry. </p><h3> Applications </h3><p><strong> Rice paddies: </strong> Flood irrigation is the standard. Rice plants thrive in standing water and require submergence. Fields are flooded 4–6 inches deep during the growing season, then drained 2 weeks before harvest. </p><p><strong> Orchards: </strong> Flood irrigation works well for fruit trees. A basin is built around each tree (a 10 × 10 foot square), and water is supplied via furrows running between trees. The basin holds water, which seeps to the root zone over 24–48 hours. </p><p><strong> Field crops (pasture, alfalfa): </strong> Some regions flood-irrigate alfalfa or pasture, holding water 2–4 inches for a few days, then moving water to the next section. </p><div class="warning"><strong> Warning: </strong> Poorly drained fields become waterlogged, killing crops. Ensure adequate drainage ditches or tile drains to remove excess water after irrigation and during heavy rains (see Section 9). </div></section><section id="furrow-irrigation"><h2> 4. Furrow Irrigation </h2><p> Furrow irrigation is the dominant method for row crops—corn, beans, squash, melons, cotton, and dozens of others. Water flows down furrows (small channels between crop rows) under gravity, wetting the soil profile between plants. It is more water-efficient than flood irrigation (50–70% compared to 40–60% for flood) and requires less land leveling. </p><h3> Design and Layout </h3><p> Furrows run downslope along crop rows. The optimal gradient (slope) is <span class="highlight"> 0.1% to 0.5% </span> . Too flat (less than 0.1%), and water moves too slowly, causing uneven wetting and seepage losses. Too steep (more than 1%), and water moves rapidly, eroding the furrow and leaving the upper end too wet and lower end too dry. </p><p> A 1-acre field with a 0.3% slope and 30-inch row spacing might have furrows 100 feet long. Water is supplied from a main ditch at the upslope end. Furrow spacing equals crop row spacing (30, 36, or 40 inches depending on the crop and planting machine). </p><h3> Water Supply Systems </h3><svg viewbox='0 0 700 450' xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label='Irrigation & Water Management diagram 1'><rect fill="#1a2e1a" height="450" width="700"></rect><g id="gravity-system"><ellipse cx="150" cy="100" fill="#53d8a8" opacity="0.3" rx="40" ry="50" stroke="#53d8a8" stroke-width="2"></ellipse><text fill="#53d8a8" font-size="12" font-weight="bold" text-anchor="middle" x="150" y="105">Spring/Tank</text><text fill="#aaa" font-size="10" text-anchor="middle" x="150" y="125">Elevated source</text><line marker-end="url(#arrowhead)" stroke="#2a9cd6" stroke-width="3" x1="190" x2="280" y1="100" y2="100"></line><text fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="10" text-anchor="middle" x="235" y="90">Main line (1 inch PVC)</text><circle cx="300" cy="100" fill="none" r="8" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2"></circle><text fill="#b8956a" font-size="10" text-anchor="middle" x="300" y="140">Valve</text><line stroke="#2a9cd6" stroke-width="2" x1="300" x2="300" y1="108" y2="200"></line><text fill="#aaa" font-size="10" x="320" y="150">Elevation drop</text><text fill="#aaa" font-size="10" x="320" y="165">= Pressure</text><g id="distribution"><circle cx="300" cy="220" fill="none" r="6" stroke="#53d8a8" stroke-width="2"></circle><text fill="#53d8a8" font-size="9" x="315" y="225">Splitter</text><line stroke="#2a9cd6" stroke-width="2" x1="280" x2="200" y1="220" y2="250"></line><line stroke="#2a9cd6" stroke-width="2" x1="300" x2="300" y1="226" y2="280"></line><line stroke="#2a9cd6" stroke-width="2" x1="320" x2="400" y1="220" y2="250"></line><text fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="10" x="150" y="290">Lateral 1</text><text fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="10" x="300" y="330">Lateral 2</text><text fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="10" x="420" y="290">Lateral 3</text></g><g id="taps"><circle cx="180" cy="280" fill="none" r="5" stroke="#e94560" stroke-width="2"></circle><line stroke="#e94560" stroke-width="1" x1="185" x2="200" y1="280" y2="280"></line><text fill="#e94560" font-size="9" x="210" y="285">Tap/faucet</text><circle cx="300" cy="340" fill="none" r="5" stroke="#e94560" stroke-width="2"></circle><line stroke="#e94560" stroke-width="1" x1="305" x2="320" y1="340" y2="340"></line><circle cx="420" cy="280" fill="none" r="5" stroke="#e94560" stroke-width="2"></circle><line stroke="#e94560" stroke-width="1" x1="425" x2="440" y1="280" y2="280"></line></g><g id="elevation-diagram"><line stroke="#aaa" stroke-dasharray="3,3" stroke-width="1" x1="500" x2="600" y1="100" y2="100"></line><line stroke="#aaa" stroke-dasharray="3,3" stroke-width="1" x1="500" x2="600" y1="280" y2="280"></line><line stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="2" x1="600" x2="600" y1="100" y2="280"></line><text fill="#d4a574" font-size="12" font-weight="bold" x="610" y="190">Elevation</text><text fill="#d4a574" font-size="12" font-weight="bold" x="610" y="210">Difference</text><text fill="#aaa" font-size="10" x="510" y="95">Source</text><text fill="#aaa" font-size="10" x="510" y="285">Field</text></g></g><defs><marker id="arrowhead" markerheight="10" markerwidth="10" orient="auto" refx="9" refy="3"><polygon fill="#2a9cd6" points='0 0, 10 3, 0 6'></polygon></marker></defs></svg><p><strong> Gated pipe: </strong> A main ditch runs along the field perimeter. Rigid aluminum or plastic pipe (4–6 inches diameter) is laid along or above the ditch, with gate openings (3 inches × 3 inches) spaced at furrow intervals (30–40 inches apart). Each gate opens to direct water into one furrow. Gated pipe is portable, durable, and allows one person to manage 20+ furrows. </p><p><strong> Siphon tubes: </strong> 3–4 inch diameter flexible tubes (PVC, poly) bridge the main ditch, with one end submerged and the other inserted into a furrow. Water siphons over the ditch bank into the furrow. Siphon tubes are cheap but labor-intensive—moving them requires manual effort and takes time. Typically used where mechanization is unavailable. </p><p><strong> Surge irrigation: </strong> An automated valve opens and closes, pulsing water into furrows. This technique reduces seepage and erosion compared to continuous flow; water infiltrates more evenly along the furrow length. </p><h3> Furrow Irrigation Operation </h3><p> A typical run irrigates all furrows in sequence: </p><ol><li> Gate or siphon is opened at furrow 1. </li><li> Water flows downslope, wetting the furrow. Duration depends on soil infiltration rate, furrow length, and crop water need—typically 1–6 hours. </li><li> The gate is closed or siphon tube moved to furrow 2. </li><li> Process repeats until all furrows are irrigated. </li><li> For a 40-furrow field, one irrigation cycle takes 2–3 days with labor or automated gates. </li></ol><h3> Water Infiltration and Advance Rate </h3><p> Advance rate (how fast water reaches the downslope end) depends on: </p><ul><li><strong> Furrow slope: </strong> Steeper slopes increase advance rate. </li><li><strong> Inflow rate: </strong> Higher flow (larger pipes/gates) advances water faster. </li><li><strong> Soil texture: </strong> Sandy soils infiltrate faster, slowing advance; clayey soils infiltrate slower, advancing water downslope faster. </li><li><strong> Soil moisture: </strong> Dry soil absorbs water rapidly; wet soil slowly. </li></ul><p> In an ideal scenario, water advances to the end of the furrow in 25–50% of the total irrigation time, then infiltrates into the root zone during the remaining time. Poor advance (water not reaching the downslope end) indicates the furrow is too long or the slope too shallow. </p><h3> Furrow Shapes </h3><p> Furrows are typically V-shaped (from cultivation implements) or rounded. The shape affects water distribution and infiltration. Wider, shallower furrows (2–3 inches wide, 2 inches deep) distribute water over a broader soil surface, good for shallow-rooted crops. Deeper V-furrows (4 inches deep) concentrate water, useful for deeper-rooted crops. </p><div class="card"><div class="card-title"> Furrow Irrigation Example </div><p> A 10-acre corn field with 30-inch rows, a 0.4% slope, and sandy loam soil. Main ditch delivers water via gated pipe. Each furrow irrigates in 2 hours. With 140 furrows, one full irrigation cycle takes 280 hours (12 days). If the field needs irrigation every 14 days during peak growth, 2 complete cycles fit comfortably, using one person's part-time labor. </p></div></section><section id="drip-trickle"><h2> 5. Drip/Trickle Irrigation </h2><p> Drip irrigation is the most water-efficient method— <span class="highlight"> 90–95% efficiency </span> compared to 50–70% for flood or furrow. Water is delivered slowly and directly to the root zone, minimizing evaporation and runoff. Disadvantages: higher infrastructure cost (if using manufactured emitters and drip line) and clogging risk if water is not filtered. </p><p> However, drip systems can be improvised from basic materials, making this method viable even in low-resource contexts. </p><h3> Manufactured Drip Systems </h3><p> A typical setup: </p><ul><li><strong> Water source: </strong> Tank or well elevated 3–6 feet above the field (gravity pressure). </li><li><strong> Filtering: </strong> Screen or sand filter removes sediment; clogged emitters are the leading failure mode. </li><li><strong> Main line: </strong> Rigid PVC or flexible poly tubing (0.75–1.5 inches diameter) runs the field length. </li><li><strong> Lateral lines: </strong> Thinner tubing (0.5 inch) branches from the main line at intervals. </li><li><strong> Drippers/emitters: </strong> Pointed stakes or in-line emitters installed at each plant. Modern dritters deliver 0.5–2 gallons per hour (gph), pressure-regulated to compensate for elevation differences. </li></ul><p> Pressure is typically 15–30 psi (pounds per square inch), maintained constant with a pressure regulator. Too low pressure, and emitters clog or deliver unevenly. Too high pressure, and emitters wear prematurely. </p><h3> Drip Irrigation Layout </h3><div class="diagram" role="figure" aria-label='Drip irrigation system layout with mainline and laterals'><svg viewbox='0 0 700 350' xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label='Irrigation & Water Management diagram 2'><rect fill="#1a2e1a" height="350" width="700"></rect><g id="drip-layout"><ellipse cx="80" cy="80" fill="#53d8a8" opacity="0.3" rx="35" ry="45" stroke="#53d8a8" stroke-width="2"></ellipse><text fill="#53d8a8" font-size="11" font-weight="bold" text-anchor="middle" x="80" y="85">Water tank</text><text fill="#aaa" font-size="9" text-anchor="middle" x="80" y="105">elevated</text><line marker-end="url(#arrowhead3)" stroke="#2a9cd6" stroke-width="3" x1="115" x2="200" y1="80" y2="80"></line><text fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="10" text-anchor="middle" x="157" y="70">Main line</text><g id="laterals"><line stroke="#2a9cd6" stroke-width="2" x1="220" x2="220" y1="80" y2="140"></line><line stroke="#2a9cd6" stroke-width="2" x1="280" x2="280" y1="80" y2="180"></line><line stroke="#2a9cd6" stroke-width="2" x1="340" x2="340" y1="80" y2="220"></line><line stroke="#2a9cd6" stroke-width="2" x1="400" x2="400" y1="80" y2="200"></line><g id="emitters"><circle cx="180" cy="140" fill="none" r="4" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="1"></circle><circle cx="220" cy="140" fill="none" r="4" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="1"></circle><circle cx="260" cy="140" fill="none" r="4" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="1"></circle><circle cx="260" cy="180" fill="none" r="4" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="1"></circle><circle cx="300" cy="180" fill="none" r="4" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="1"></circle><circle cx="340" cy="220" fill="none" r="4" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="1"></circle><circle cx="380" cy="220" fill="none" r="4" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="1"></circle><circle cx="400" cy="200" fill="none" r="4" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="1"></circle><circle cx="440" cy="200" fill="none" r="4" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="1"></circle></g></g><g id="soil"><rect fill="#8B7355" height="150" opacity="0.3" width="700" y="280"></rect><text fill="#aaa" font-size="11" text-anchor="middle" x="350" y="360">SOIL (water infiltrates slowly)</text></g><text fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="11" x="500" y="100">Drip emitters:</text><text fill="#aaa" font-size="10" x="500" y="120">0.5-2 gal per hour</text><text fill="#aaa" font-size="10" x="500" y="135">Water seeps directly</text><text fill="#aaa" font-size="10" x="500" y="150">to root zone</text><text fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="11" x="500" y="190">Efficiency: 90-95%</text><text fill="#aaa" font-size="10" x="500" y="210">Minimal evaporation</text></g><defs><marker id="arrowhead3" markerheight="10" markerwidth="10" orient="auto" refx="9" refy="3"><polygon fill="#2a9cd6" points='0 0, 10 3, 0 6'></polygon></marker></defs></svg></div><h3> Improvised Drip Systems—Punctured Containers </h3><p> A simple drip system requires only containers and a drill or nail: </p><ul><li> Take a 5-gallon bucket or plastic jug. </li><li> Drill small holes (3/32 inch, or hammered nail holes) near the bottom. </li><li> Bury the bucket next to a plant, with the top at or just above soil surface. </li><li> Fill with water; it seeps out through holes into the root zone over 4–12 hours (depending on hole size and soil). </li><li> Refill every 1–2 days as needed. </li></ul><p> Advantages: zero cost (use recycled containers), zero clogging, simple.

The technique is ancient, used by indigenous cultures in the Americas and Middle East for millennia. </p><p><strong> How it works: </strong></p><ul><li> Source material: An unglazed terracotta pot (4–6 quart size, similar to a Greek amphora but simpler shape). </li><li> Placement: Bury the olla in the root zone of plants, with the top of the pot at or just below soil surface (or the pot is left protruding slightly so you can fill it). </li><li> Filling: Pour water into the olla; it gradually seeps through the porous clay into the surrounding soil over 24–48 hours. </li><li> Refilling: As soil dries and water is drawn into the surrounding soil, you refill the olla. One filling may suffice 2–3 days depending on heat and soil. </li></ul><p><strong> Why it works: </strong> The clay is slightly porous; water molecules move through the clay matrix via capillary action, driven by the suction of drying soil. As surrounding soil dries, the water potential gradient increases, pulling more water through the clay. The effect is a self-regulating drip—no water leaks if soil is saturated, but water flows freely as soil dries. This is exquisitely elegant. </p><p><strong> Advantages: </strong></p><ul><li> No manufactured parts or clogging risk. </li><li> No pressure or power required. </li><li> One olla irrigates 4–8 plants depending on pot size and crop water demand. </li><li> Reduces water use by 50–70% compared to flood irrigation. </li><li> Ollas last decades if protected from freezing (clay cracks if water inside freezes). </li></ul><p><strong> Implementation: </strong> Ollas are commercially available (search "terracotta irrigation ollas") but can also be DIY—use any unglazed terracotta pot with a drainage hole, caulk or plug the hole, and bury it. For a small vegetable garden (20–30 plants), 5–10 ollas spaced appropriately irrigate the entire area with one person filling them 1–2 times per week. </p><h3> Bamboo and PVC Drip Lines </h3><p> In regions with bamboo, small-diameter bamboo culm (stem) or hollowed bamboo segments deliver water. Bamboo is naturally water-conductive and porous; water seeps along its length, creating a natural drip effect. This is used in parts of Asia and South America. </p><p> Similarly, small-diameter PVC or poly pipe can be perforated (drilled holes at intervals of 12–24 inches) and laid along rows. Water is supplied via gravity from an elevated tank. This is low-cost and simple, though less uniform than manufactured drip systems. </p><h3> Water Efficiency Comparison </h3><table class="comparison-table"><thead><tr><th scope="col"> Method </th><th scope="col"> Efficiency (%) </th><th scope="col"> Water Loss </th><th scope="col"> Infrastructure Cost </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> Flood Irrigation </td><td> 40–60% </td><td> Evaporation, runoff, deep seepage </td><td> Low (berms, ditches) </td></tr><tr><td> Furrow Irrigation </td><td> 50–70% </td><td> Evaporation, seepage </td><td> Low-medium (gated pipe or siphons) </td></tr><tr><td> Drip (manufactured) </td><td> 90–95% </td><td> Minimal evaporation </td><td> High (emitters, regulators, filters) </td></tr><tr><td> Olla (clay pot) </td><td> 85–95% </td><td> Minimal evaporation </td><td> Very low (clay pots) </td></tr><tr><td> Punctured containers </td><td> 75–90% </td><td> Some evaporation </td><td> Minimal (recycled containers) </td></tr></tbody></table><div class="card"><div class="card-title"> Olla Irrigation Case Study </div><p> A small market garden (0.25 acres, 100 plants) in a semi-arid region with 12 inches annual rainfall. Using flood irrigation, the field requires ~24,000 gallons per growing season (May–September). Using clay pot ollas (one per 8 plants, 12 ollas total), water demand drops to ~6,000 gallons (from rainwater harvesting in spring, supplemented with well water). Investment: 12 clay pots at ~$5 each = $60. ROI: achieved in one season through water savings and increased yield (less waterlogging, healthier plants). </p></div></section><section id="terracing"><h2> 6. Terracing </h2><p> Terracing transforms hillsides into productive agricultural land by cutting steps, each with a level or gently sloping surface to catch water and prevent erosion. Terracing is essential in mountainous regions (Southeast Asia, Andes, Mediterranean) where flat land is scarce. Beyond enabling irrigation, terraces reduce soil erosion, capture seasonal rainfall, and allow otherwise marginal slopes to support permanent crops. </p><h3> Why Terrace? </h3><ul><li><strong> Level planting surface: </strong> Crops can be grown on slopes that would otherwise shed water and cause erosion. </li><li><strong> Water capture: </strong> Level or slightly inward-sloping surfaces retain rainfall, increasing infiltration and reducing runoff. </li><li><strong> Erosion control: </strong> By breaking the slope into steps, terrace benches reduce water velocity, cutting erosion by 70–90%. </li><li><strong> Irrigation efficiency: </strong> Flood irrigation and furrow systems function on terraced fields, whereas they are impractical on steep slopes. </li></ul><h3> Bench Terraces </h3><p> A bench terrace is a nearly level platform cut into the hillside. The cross-section shows a cut (excavation) on the uphill side and a fill (embankment) on the downhill side. For a 30-degree slope, typical bench width is 10–20 feet, allowing space for 1–2 crop rows. </p><p><strong> Construction: </strong></p><ul><li> Mark contour lines at vertical intervals of 3–5 feet (in steep terrain) or 5–10 feet (gentler slopes), running horizontally around the hillside. </li><li> Begin at the top contour. Excavate uphill, removing soil to create a level surface. Cut depth depends on slope angle and desired bench width. </li><li> Use excavated soil to build a retaining wall or embankment on the downhill edge (the riser). Compact in layers. </li><li> The bench surface should be perfectly level (for flood irrigation) or gently sloped 0.5–1% downslope to prevent waterlogging. </li><li> Repeat for each contour downslope. </li></ul><p> A well-built bench terrace lasts 50+ years. The retaining wall (riser) must be stable; steep risers (more than 4:1) may collapse if soil is loose. Typical stable slopes are 1.5:1 (1.5 feet horizontal per 1 foot vertical). </p><h3> Sloping Terraces </h3><p> A sloping terrace (also called a <span class="highlight"> conservation terrace </span> or <span class="highlight"> bund </span> ) is a gentle bench with a 1–3% downslope. Rather than being completely level, it slopes slightly downhill in the direction of field contour. This reduces waterlogging and is suitable for crops that don't require standing water (corn, cassava, perennial trees). The surface is less level than a bench terrace, easier to construct, and drains well. </p><h3> Retaining Structures </h3><p> Terraces require retaining structures to stabilize the uphill cut and downhill fill: </p><ul><li><strong> Stone walls: </strong> Dry-stacked or mortared stone walls are traditional and durable. A 4-foot-high wall requires a foundation 2–3 feet deep, and a base width of 3 feet (sloping inward). Stone walls last centuries. </li><li><strong> Log barriers: </strong> In forested regions, large-diameter logs (8–12 inches) are laid horizontally across the slope, anchored with stakes. Effective for 5–10 years before decay. </li><li><strong> Earth embankments: </strong> Simple compacted soil; less durable than stone but adequate for low hills (less than 15-foot drop). Vegetate with grass or shrubs to stabilize surface. </li><li><strong> Living barriers: </strong> Rows of fast-growing shrubs or trees planted along the contour. Roots bind soil, reducing erosion. Examples: vetiver grass, leucaena trees, bamboo. Living barriers take 1–2 years to fully stabilize but are cost-effective and self-sustaining. </li></ul><h3> Terrace Diagram </h3><svg viewbox='0 0 600 400' xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label='Irrigation & Water Management diagram 3'><defs><pattern height="8" id="soil1" patternunits="userSpaceOnUse" width="8"><rect fill="#8b7355" height="8" width="8"></rect><circle cx="4" cy="4" fill="#6b5344" r="1.5"></circle></pattern></defs><rect fill="url(#soil1)" height="100" width="500" x="50" y="280"></rect><rect fill="#a0a060" height="60" width="500" x="50" y="220"></rect><line stroke="#444" stroke-dasharray="4" stroke-width="1" x1="50" x2="550" y1="220" y2="220"></line><rect fill="#a0a060" height="60" width="500" x="50" y="160"></rect><line stroke="#444" stroke-dasharray="4" stroke-width="1" x1="50" x2="550" y1="160" y2="160"></line><rect fill="#a0a060" height="60" width="500" x="50" y="100"></rect><line stroke="#444" stroke-dasharray="4" stroke-width="1" x1="50" x2="550" y1="100" y2="100"></line><line stroke="#666" stroke-width="2" x1="50" x2="50" y1="100" y2="280"></line><text fill="#ccc" font-size="12" x="30" y="190"> Cut </text><line stroke="#888" stroke-width="2" x1="550" x2="550" y1="100" y2="280"></line><text fill="#ccc" font-size="12" x="555" y="190"> Fill/Wall </text><rect fill="#c0a080" height="60" stroke="#666" stroke-width="1" width="10" x="540" y="160"></rect><text fill="#ccc" font-size="11" x="560" y="195"> Stone/Log </text><circle cx="150" cy="230" fill="#53d8a8" r="3"></circle><circle cx="250" cy="230" fill="#53d8a8" r="3"></circle><circle cx="350" cy="230" fill="#53d8a8" r="3"></circle><circle cx="150" cy="170" fill="#53d8a8" r="3"></circle><circle cx="250" cy="170" fill="#53d8a8" r="3"></circle><circle cx="350" cy="170" fill="#53d8a8" r="3"></circle><line stroke="#e94560" stroke-dasharray="2" stroke-width="1" x1="100" x2="100" y1="280" y2="100"></line><text fill="#e94560" font-size="11" x="105" y="190"> Slope </text><text fill="#999" font-size="10" x="560" y="235"> Bench 1 </text><text fill="#999" font-size="10" x="560" y="175"> Bench 2 </text><text fill="#999" font-size="10" x="560" y="115"> Bench 3 </text></svg><h3> Water Management on Terraces </h3><p> Bench terraces can be flood-irrigated (water fills to a level depth) or furrow-irrigated (water runs down furrows between rows). The level surface is ideal for flood irrigation of rice or for basin irrigation of tree crops. The terrace edge (typically with a small berm or ditch) directs water flow and prevents edge erosion. </p><p> On rainfed terraces, the level or gently sloping surface captures and infiltrates rainfall. In monsoon regions, terraces often outperform other water conservation techniques by 30–50% in terms of yield per unit rainfall. </p><h3> Labor and Timeline </h3><p> Constructing terraces is labor-intensive. A team of 10 workers can construct about 100 linear feet of bench terrace (with stone walls) per day on moderate slope. A 1-acre hillside might require 200–400 linear feet of terraces depending on width and contour, translating to 2–4 weeks of labor with a small team. However, the investment pays off over 30–50 years of productive land use. </p><div class="card"><div class="card-title"> Terrace Economics </div><p> A 2-acre hillside (30-degree slope) with 15-foot bench width requires ~800 linear feet of terracing. Labor cost (at $15/day, 10 workers): ~$1,200. Over 40 years, the annual cost is $30. The increased yield (due to level surface and better water infiltration) is typically 2–3 tons/acre/year for rice or 1–2 tons/acre/year for corn, valued at $300–1,000/year. ROI achieved in first year; terraces are multi-generational assets. </p></div></section><section id="water-lifting"><h2> 7. Water Lifting Devices </h2><p> Where water sources (rivers, springs, wells) are below irrigation fields, lifting devices are necessary. For thousands of years, ingenious mechanical devices have solved this problem using human or animal power, water power, or (in modern times) electric or fuel-powered pumps. This section covers traditional devices that require no fuel and minimal maintenance. </p><h3> Shaduf (Counterweighted Lever) </h3><p> The shaduf is among the oldest water-lifting devices, used in Egypt for millennia and still common in parts of Asia and Africa. A long beam pivots on a fulcrum; one end has a bucket, the other a counterweight (typically sand or stones in a basket). </p><p><strong> Operation: </strong> One person pulls down the bucket end, submerging the bucket in water. The counterweight rises. At the bottom, the person releases; the counterweight descends, lifting the filled bucket. The person tips the bucket into a trough or basin, and repeats. A skilled operator can lift water 6–10 feet and deliver approximately <span class="highlight"> 600 gallons per day </span> at a sustainable pace. </p><p><strong> Advantages: </strong> Simple construction, no manufactured parts, minimal maintenance, one person can operate indefinitely. </p><p><strong> Construction: </strong> A 20-foot beam (bamboo or hardwood), balanced on a pivot (stone or wood block), with a rope-and-bucket system on one end and a counterweight on the other. Beam height determines lift height; a 20-foot beam can lift water 8–10 feet. The counterweight is typically 1.5 to 2 times the bucket weight for mechanical advantage. </p><h3> Archimedes Screw </h3><p> An inclined tube containing a helical blade (spiral) that rotates inside the tube, moving water upward. As the screw rotates, water is trapped in the spiral grooves and advanced upward, exiting at the top. </p><p><strong> Specifications: </strong> Diameter 8–12 inches, length 10–15 feet, lift height 3–15 feet (depending on incline angle), angle typically 30–45 degrees from horizontal. </p><p><strong> Power: </strong> Hand-cranked (one person, ~50 gallons/minute) or animal-powered via gear or belt drive. The gear ratio is crucial; without gearing, hand-cranking becomes very difficult at higher flow rates. </p><p><strong> Construction: </strong> Traditionally made from wood (helical blade carved into wood, or separate blade wrapped around a central shaft). Modern versions use PVC or steel. The enclosing tube is wood, metal, or masonry. </p><p><strong> Advantage: </strong> Handles sandy/muddy water better than centrifugal pumps; continuous, relatively high flow; no valves to clog. </p><h3> Noria (Water Wheel) </h3><p> A large wheel (10–20 feet diameter) fitted with buckets around its rim. The wheel is partially submerged in a flowing stream or river; water current turns the wheel. As the wheel rotates, buckets fill at the bottom and empty at the top into a collection channel or aqueduct. </p><p><strong> Advantages: </strong> Powered by water flow (no human labor), continuous operation, large lift heights possible, historically powered major irrigation systems in the Mediterranean and Middle East. </p><p><strong> Disadvantages: </strong> Requires a reliable flowing stream, large structure with significant wood/materials investment, complex maintenance, sensitive to stream level changes. </p><p><strong> Water delivery: </strong> A noria 15 feet in diameter in a 2-knot stream current can lift approximately 5,000–10,000 gallons per hour to a height of 15–20 feet. This was sufficient to supply irrigation for hundreds of acres. </p><p><strong> Example: </strong> Medieval noria installations along the Orontes River in Syria, some still operating, have supported agriculture for 1,500+ years with minimal maintenance. </p><h3> Chain Pump / Persian Wheel </h3><p> A large wheel (4–6 feet diameter) fitted with a chain or rope carrying small cups. The wheel is turned by animals (oxen, donkeys, horses) via a gear or belt, or hand-cranked. As the wheel rotates, cups pick up water at the bottom and dump it at the top. </p><p><strong> Specifications: </strong> Wheel diameter 4–8 feet, lift height 10–30 feet (limited by chain length), flow rate 2,000–5,000 gallons/hour depending on wheel size and rotation speed. </p><p><strong> Power requirement: </strong> A horse or ox can continuously drive a chain pump lifting water 20 feet at 3,000 gallons/hour. This requires the animal to move at a steady walk, doing no other work. </p><p><strong> Advantage: </strong> Higher lift than shaduf, animal-powered (scalable to available labor), continuous operation during animal working hours. </p><h3> Treadle Pump </h3><p> A suction pump operated by foot (like a bicycle pedal). One person stands on two treadles, pumping up and down in a motion similar to climbing stairs. With each cycle, a piston inside the pump chamber moves, drawing water from a shallow well and discharging it into a bucket or trough. </p><p><strong> Specifications: </strong> Lifts from shallow wells (10–25 feet depth), discharges 5–10 gallons per minute at a sustainable pace (one person, continuous operation is 30 minutes before fatigue). Maximum height: 25–30 feet. </p><p><strong> Advantages: </strong> Very cheap to manufacture (can be made from PVC pipe and wood), no external power, sustainable for small plots (gardens, small orchards). </p><p><strong> Limitation: </strong> Hand-and-foot pumping is laborious; practical for <1 acre of daily irrigation need. For larger fields, multiple treadle pumps or animal-powered devices are needed. </p><h3> Water Lifting Devices Comparison </h3><svg viewbox='0 0 800 500' xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"

Ditches & Canals </h2><p> Once water is captured, it must be transported to fields via a network of channels. A well-designed ditch system minimizes water loss, prevents erosion, and allows farmers to manage flow and timing precisely. </p><h3> Hierarchy of Channels </h3><ul><li><strong> Main canal: </strong> The primary artery, carrying water from the source (river intake, reservoir, spring) across the landscape. May be 20–100+ feet wide, supply multiple communities or regions. </li><li><strong> Lateral ditch: </strong> Secondary branches off the main canal, serving a subregion or watershed. Typically 5–20 feet wide. </li><li><strong> Field ditch: </strong> Tertiary branches, running along field edges or between plots. Typically 2–6 feet wide, supplying individual farmers or small groups. </li></ul><p> Water flows downslope under gravity. The entire system must be graded; reverse slopes or low points cause pooling and water loss. </p><h3> Ditch Construction </h3><p> A basic unlined ditch is excavated to depth and width appropriate for the flow volume: </p><ul><li><strong> Width: </strong> Determined by flow rate (more water = wider channel). A rough guide: 1 foot width per 100 gallons/minute of flow. </li><li><strong> Depth: </strong> Typically equal to or slightly less than width (to prevent tall, unstable walls). Minimal depth ~18 inches for small field ditches, 3–6 feet for large canals. </li><li><strong> Grade (slope): </strong> 0.1–1% depending on soil and velocity desired. Steeper grades accelerate water, increasing erosion; shallower grades slow water, increasing infiltration loss. </li><li><strong> Banks: </strong> Side slopes are typically 1.5:1 (1.5 feet horizontal per 1 foot vertical), stable for most soils. Steeper slopes are prone to collapse in loose soil. </li></ul><h3> Lining Materials </h3><p> Unlined ditches lose 10–50% of water to seepage, especially in sandy or permeable soils. Lining reduces seepage dramatically: </p><ul><li><strong> Clay: </strong> A compacted clay layer (4–8 inches) reduces seepage to 5–10%. Most cost-effective in clay-rich regions; labor-intensive but no material cost if local clay available. </li><li><strong> Concrete: </strong> Modern, durable, seepage <1%. High upfront cost; modern canals (dam spillways, urban water conveyance) use concrete. </li><li><strong> Plastic sheeting (HDPE, PVC): </strong> If available, cost-effective (<$1/sq ft in bulk). Lasts 10–20 years in UV-protected (buried) conditions. Prone to puncture; requires care during installation. </li></ul><p> For a farmer with limited budget and local clay, clay lining is ideal. Excavate the ditch 4 inches deeper than target depth. Bring in clay (or use clay from another part of the property), and compact 6 inches in the bottom and 4 inches up the sides. </p><h3> Maintenance </h3><p> Ditches require ongoing upkeep to function: </p><ul><li><strong> Vegetation control: </strong> Weeds, grass, and shrubs in and around ditches reduce flow and cause clogging. Clear vegetation seasonally (before irrigation season) and as needed. </li><li><strong> Bank repair: </strong> Erosion, especially at the outside (concave) banks of curves, weakens embankments. Repair with compacted soil or additional clay; stabilize with grass planting. </li><li><strong> Sediment removal: </strong> Rivers and surface runoff bring sand, silt, and gravel. These settle in ditches, reducing capacity. Periodically dredge or scrape bottoms, especially in main canals. Sediment can be spread on fields (it carries nutrients). </li><li><strong> Rodent control: </strong> Burrowing rodents (muskrats, voles) damage ditch banks. Trapping, predator encouragement, or fencing helps. </li></ul><h3> Flow Control Structures </h3><p> Gates, weirs, and sluices allow farmers to manage water distribution: </p><ul><li><strong> Sluice gate: </strong> A sliding vertical gate in a ditch, raised or lowered to control flow. Simple gates are wooden boards sliding in grooves. </li><li><strong> Weir: </strong> A fixed barrier (usually concrete, stone, or sandbags) across a ditch, raising water level behind it. Water overtops the weir and flows into the next section. Used to equalize flow in canals. </li><li><strong> Check gate: </strong> A small weir in field ditches, creating a pool. Farmers open gates/siphons into adjacent furrows or basins. Common in furrow-irrigated fields. </li></ul><h3> Water Rights and Distribution </h3><p> In communities sharing a water source, rules allocate water. Traditional systems: </p><ul><li><strong> Time-sharing: </strong> Each farmer receives water for a set number of hours per week. During their time slot, they can draw water without restriction; outside their slot, water goes to the next farmer. </li><li><strong> Flow-sharing: </strong> Water is divided proportionally, typically by field size or historical use. Each farmer receives a fixed fraction of the ditch flow continuously. </li><li><strong> Reservoir rotation: </strong> In regions with rainy and dry seasons, farmers fill small reservoirs during the rainy season, then manage their own water during the dry season. </li></ul><p> Enforcement of water rights is crucial. Communal management (water user associations) has proven effective in regions from the Philippines to Peru to India, reducing conflict and improving overall efficiency. </p></section><section id="drainage"><h2> 9. Drainage </h2><p> Paradoxically, while irrigation adds water, drainage—the removal of excess water—is equally vital. Waterlogged soil (soil saturation and standing water) kills most crops by depriving roots of oxygen. Equally dangerous is salt accumulation; in arid regions, irrigation without drainage causes salts to accumulate in the upper soil profile, rendering land sterile. Proper drainage is the complement to successful irrigation. </p><h3> Problems from Poor Drainage </h3><ul><li><strong> Root rot: </strong> Anaerobic (oxygen-starved) soil allows pathogenic fungi to thrive, rotting roots and killing plants. </li><li><strong> Toxic gases: </strong> In anaerobic soil, bacteria produce hydrogen sulfide, methane, and other phytotoxic gases that damage roots. </li><li><strong> Nutrient imbalance: </strong> Waterlogged soil has altered chemistry; some nutrients become unavailable, others reach toxic levels. </li><li><strong> Salinity: </strong> In arid climates, water applied to fields evaporates, leaving salts. Without drainage to flush these salts, they accumulate. After 5–10 years of unremediated salt buildup, the field becomes unproductive. </li><li><strong> Compaction: </strong> Walking on waterlogged soil compacts the soil, reducing porosity and worsening drainage. </li></ul><h3> Types of Drainage Systems </h3><h4> Open Ditches </h4><p> The simplest form: a visible ditch in or around the field collecting excess water. These are: </p><ul><li><strong> Field ditches: </strong> Shallow channels (1–2 feet deep, 2–3 feet wide) running along field edges or between plots, sloping downhill. </li><li><strong> Main drainage ditches: </strong> Larger channels (2–4 feet deep) into which field ditches drain, leading to a river, lake, or pond. </li></ul><p> Advantages: simple, visible, easy to maintain, low cost. Disadvantages: take up land (reduce planting area by 5–10%), can become weed-infested, unsafe for children/animals, reduce cultivation flexibility. </p><h4> Tile Drains / French Drains </h4><p> Underground drainage systems that remove water without taking up surface land. A <span class="highlight"> French drain </span> is a narrow trench (12–18 inches wide) filled with coarse gravel and a perforated pipe at the bottom. Water seeps through soil into gravel, then into the pipe, which carries it to a drainage ditch or outlet. </p><p><strong> Installation: </strong></p><ul><li> Dig a trench slightly deeper than the water table needs to be lowered, running from the field to an outlet (ditch or stream). </li><li> Grade the trench bottom 0.1–0.3% slope toward the outlet. </li><li> Place 4 inches of coarse sand or fine gravel in the bottom. </li><li> Lay perforated PVC or clay tile pipe (3–4 inches diameter) on the gravel. </li><li> Cover the pipe with 6–12 inches of gravel (acts as a filter), then place a fabric filter layer on top. </li><li> Backfill with topsoil. </li></ul><p> Spacing: In clay soils, drains are spaced 30–50 feet apart; in sandy soils, 100+ feet. The spacing is determined by the soil's water conductivity—poor conductivity requires closer drains. </p><p> Cost: ~$1,000–2,000 per acre for complete tile drain installation (depending on depth and complexity). Lifespan: 30–50 years if properly designed. </p><h4> Raised Bed / Mounding </h4><p> In wet climates or poorly draining soils, crops are grown on raised beds 12–24 inches above the surrounding level. Between beds, drainage ditches collect water. This approach is common in temperate regions with clay soils (much of Northern Europe). </p><h3> Salinity Management </h3><p> In arid regions, salinity is the dominant threat to irrigated land. Prevention is far better than remediation: </p><ul><li><strong> Good drainage: </strong> Every irrigation application should be followed by drainage, either via surface ditches or tile drains. Excess water flushes salts out of the root zone. </li><li><strong> Leaching fraction: </strong> Apply 10–20% more water than plants use; the extra water drains, carrying salts with it. Example: if a crop needs 20 inches of water per season, apply 22–24 inches; the extra 2–4 inches leaches salts. </li><li><strong> Low-salt water source: </strong> Where possible, use water with low salt content (mountain springs, rainwater harvesting). Rivers in arid regions often carry high salt loads. </li><li><strong> Salt-tolerant crops: </strong> Barley, alfalfa, dates, and some grapes tolerate higher salinity than wheat, corn, or potatoes. Adjust crop selection to water salinity. </li><li><strong> Soil amendment: </strong> For severely saline soils, apply gypsum (calcium sulfate), which displaces sodium (a major salt) and allows leaching. This is expensive but necessary as a last resort. </li></ul><h3> Salinity Assessment </h3><p> Visible signs of salinity: </p><ul><li> White crust on soil surface (salt precipitation). </li><li> Poor germination or stunted plant growth (especially leaf edges). </li><li> Bare patches in the field (salt-killed zones). </li></ul><p> Quantitative: Measure soil electrical conductivity (EC) with a simple meter (available for ~$50). EC > 4 dS/m indicates salinity problems for most crops. Salt-tolerant crops tolerate EC 8–12 dS/m. </p><div class="warning"><strong> Warning: </strong> Once salinity reaches 8–12 dS/m, rehabilitation is expensive and slow. Prevention through good drainage and leaching is essential. In some arid regions, irrigated agriculture has been abandoned due to salt buildup from decades of irrigation without adequate drainage. </div></section><section id="water-scheduling"><h2> 10. Water Scheduling </h2><p> When to irrigate is as important as how much. Over-irrigation wastes water, causes disease, and leaches nutrients. Under-irrigation reduces yield and stresses plants. Optimal irrigation matches water application to plant need, adjusted for rainfall, soil type, and growth stage. </p><h3> Crop Water Requirements </h3><p> Plants use water mainly through transpiration (water lost from leaves) and, to a lesser extent, direct evaporation from soil. Collectively, this is called <span class="highlight"> evapotranspiration (ET) </span> , measured in inches per week or millimeters per day. </p><p> ET varies dramatically by crop and climate: </p><ul><li><strong> High-ET crops (tomatoes, corn, alfalfa): </strong> 0.20–0.30 inches per day in summer. </li><li><strong> Low-ET crops (lettuce, spinach, root vegetables): </strong> 0.10–0.15 inches per day. </li><li><strong> Cold climate: </strong> ET is lower due to cooler temperatures and lower evaporative demand. </li><li><strong> Arid climate: </strong> ET is higher due to low humidity and high radiation. </li></ul><p> A rough estimate: ET ≈ 0.2 to 0.3 inches per day in midsummer. In spring and fall, ET is half. In winter, ET is minimal. </p><h3> Three Methods to Determine When to Irrigate </h3><h4> 1. Soil Moisture Testing (Feel Method) </h4><p> The simplest, oldest method: dig into the soil at the root zone depth (4–12 inches for vegetables, 12–24 inches for trees) and assess soil moisture by feel. </p><p><strong> Procedure: </strong></p><ul><li> Excavate a small hole, 6–12 inches deep. </li><li> Take a handful of soil and squeeze firmly in your fist. </li><li><strong> Saturated (just watered or waterlogged): </strong> Water drips from your hand. </li><li><strong> Wet: </strong> Soil forms a firm ball that doesn't crumble. This is adequate moisture; don't irrigate. </li><li><strong> Moist: </strong> Soil forms a ball but crumbles easily if pressed. This is the ideal target—plants have adequate water, but soil is not waterlogged. Irrigate soon if rain isn't expected. </li><li><strong> Dry: </strong> Soil doesn't hold together; it crumbles immediately. Irrigate immediately. </li></ul><p> Test 3–5 locations in the field; conditions vary. Repeat every 2–3 days during the growing season to monitor changes. </p><h4> 2. Plant Observation </h4><p> Plants give visual signals of water stress: </p><ul><li><strong> Wilting: </strong> Leaves droop in early morning (before sun heats the plant). This indicates the soil moisture is very low; irrigate today. </li><li><strong> Leaf color: </strong> Water-stressed plants often show pale or yellowish leaves (nitrogen chlorosis) due to impaired nutrient uptake. This is a sign of moderate stress. </li><li><strong> Leaf curl or rolling: </strong> Some plants (corn, sorghum) curl leaves under water stress, a protective mechanism. Irrigate soon. </li></ul><p> Plant observation is responsive but delayed—by the time wilting is visible, yield has already been reduced. Best used in combination with soil moisture testing. </p><h4> 3. Calendar-Based Scheduling </h4><p> Plan irrigation timing based on crop growth stages and average water needs: </p><ul><li><strong> Germination/establishment: </strong> Keep soil consistently moist (not saturated). Irrigate every 2–3 days or when top 1 inch of soil becomes dry. </li><li><strong> Vegetative growth (pre-flowering): </strong> Water need is high. Irrigate when soil moisture is moist (not wet) to dry. Typically every 5–7 days depending on climate and rainfall. </li><li><strong> Flowering and fruit development: </strong> Water demand is peak. Irrigate every 3–5 days or more frequently. Consistent moisture is essential; water stress causes flower/fruit drop. </li><li><strong> Late fruit development/ripening: </strong> Depending on the crop, water may be reduced to concentrate sugars (wine grapes) or maintained to maximize yield (tomatoes). Check specific crop requirements. </li><li><strong> Harvest and post-harvest: </strong> Irrigate minimally or not at all, unless ensuring forage crops regrow. </li></ul><p> Example: Corn. Plant in May, germinate/establish May–early June (irrigate every 3 days if no rain). Vegetative growth June–early July (irrigate every 7 days). Silking/tasseling/early grain fill July–August (irrigate every 4 days—critical period). Grain fill August–September (irrigate every 7 days if needed). Harvest October. </p><h3> Irrigation Frequency and Duration </h3><p> For a given crop and climate, irrigation is scheduled as: </p><div class="formula-box"> Interval = Soil Available Water Capacity / Daily ET Duration = Amount Needed / Application Rate </div><p> Example: Tomatoes on sandy loam soil (available water capacity = 0.75 inches per foot of depth). Root zone = 12 inches. Total available water = 0.75 inches. Summer ET = 0.25 inches/day. Irrigation interval = 0.75 / 0.25 = 3 days. So irrigate every 3 days. </p><p> If irrigation is via drip (delivery rate 0.5 inches/hour) and 0.75 inches is needed, duration = 0.75 / 0.5 = 1.5 hours. </p><h3> Accounting for Rainfall </h3><p> Rainfall reduces irrigation need. If it rains 0.5 inches, that counts toward the water requirement: </p><div class="formula-box"> Irrigation Needed = ET Demand – Rainfall – Stored Soil Moisture </div><p> In monsoon or humid regions, supplemental irrigation may be needed only during brief dry spells. In semi-arid and arid regions, supplemental irrigation is the norm throughout the growing season, with rainfall contributing 20% or less of total water need. </p><h3> Scheduling at Critical Growth Stages </h3><p> Some crops are sensitive to water stress at specific times: </p><ul><li><strong> Corn: </strong> Most critical from tasseling (silks emerge) through early grain fill (30 days). Water stress during this window reduces yield 30–50%. Ensure consistent moisture; don't miss irrigation even for a day. </li><li><strong> Rice: </strong> Keep paddies flooded throughout the season. Drain only 2 weeks before harvest. </li><li><strong> Tomato/pepper: </strong> Flower initiation and fruit set (3–4 weeks before first flower, until flowering ends). Stress causes flower drop and reduced yield. Maintain consistent moisture. </li><li><strong> Wheat: </strong> Booting and heading (flower initiation). Water stress reduces grain number and weight. </li><li><strong> Alfalfa: </strong> Most critical 2 weeks post-cut as the plant regrows. Stress reduces the next cut's yield. </li></ul><p> Focus management effort on critical periods. Non-critical periods can tolerate some water stress without yield loss. </p><h3> Water Quality Monitoring </h3><p> Beyond amount, water quality affects crop health: </p><ul><li><strong> Salinity (EC > 4 dS/m): </strong> Reduces yield, especially in salt-sensitive crops. Use salt-tolerant cultivars or increase leaching fraction. </li><li><strong> pH: </strong> Optimal 6.0–7.5 for most crops. Very acidic (<5.5) or alkaline (>8.5) water can affect nutrient availability. </li><li><strong> Iron / manganese: </strong> In some regions, groundwater is high in iron, which stains equipment and plants. Aeration or pH adjustment helps. </li><li><strong> Pathogens (if recirculating water): </strong> Recycled water from ponds may carry disease. Drip irrigation (filtered) is safer than flood irrigation with pond water. </li></ul><h3> Record Keeping </h3><p> Maintain a simple log during the growing season: </p><ul><li> Irrigation date, amount (hours or inches), and duration. </li><li> Rainfall amount and date. </li><li> Soil moisture observations (date, location, assessment). </li><li> Plant observations (phenology, stress symptoms). </li><li> Yield at harvest. </li></ul><p> After 1–2 seasons, patterns emerge, and you can refine your schedule. A farmer with 5 years of records can predict water needs with 80%+ accuracy. </p></section><div class="related-guides"><h3> Related Guides </h3><ul><li><a href="agriculture.html"> agriculture.html </a> — Crop selection, soil preparation, pest/disease management </li><li><a href="well-drilling.html"> well-drilling.html </a> — Hand-dug wells, percussion drilling, water table assessment </li><li><a href="plumbing-pipes.html"> plumbing-pipes.html </a> — PVC/poly sizing, gravity systems, pressure regulators </li><li><a href="construction.html"> construction.html </a> — Dams, reservoirs, earthmoving, soil compaction </li><li><a href="weather-geology.html"> weather-geology.html </a> — Climate patterns, groundwater geology, soil classification </li></ul></div></main><div class="common-mistakes"><h3> Common Mistakes </h3><ul><li> Add specific common mistakes here based on the guide content </li></ul></div><div class="notes-section"><div class="notes-header"><span> My Notes </span><span class="notes-toggle"> ▼ </span></div><div class="notes-content"><textarea class="notes-textarea" id="guide-notes-text" placeholder='Add your personal notes here.
