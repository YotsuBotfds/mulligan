Animals: dogs (90%+ human deaths), bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, coyotes. Incubation: typically 1-3 months but highly variable (weeks to years, longer incubation = slower progression). No treatment once symptomatic (nearly 100% fatal); prevention critical via post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).</p><h3>Clinical Presentation</h3><p><strong>Prodromal phase (2-10 days):</strong> Fever, malaise, headache, sensory changes at bite site (tingling, burning). <strong>Active disease phase:</strong> Encephalitis symptoms (agitation, aggression, hypersalivation, hydrophobia [fear of swallowing], hallucinations, delirium). OR paralytic rabies: descending paralysis from bite site. <strong>Terminal phase:</strong> Coma, death typically from respiratory failure.</p><h3>Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)</h3><p>Must start immediately after exposure (bite/scratch/mucous membrane contact with saliva from high-risk animal). Delays >24 hours reduce efficacy. Components: 1) Wound washing (vigorous with soap and water, removes virus, very important). 2) Rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) infiltrated around wound if available (20IU/kg). 3) Rabies vaccine: series injections (traditionally 5 injections; newer 4-dose schedules available if supplies limited).</p><h3>Animal Assessment</h3><p>If animal caught: quarantine for observation (10 days for dogs/cats). If animal shows no symptoms after 10 days: likely not rabid, but observation recommended for full incubation period. If animal shows symptoms/dies: must assume rabid and administer PEP. If animal cannot be captured: assume rabid and give PEP.</p></section><section id=leptospirosis><h2>Leptospirosis</h2><h3>Transmission and Reservoir</h3><p>Transmission: urine from infected animals (rats, mice, livestock) in water/wet environments. Contamination: entry through breaks in skin, mucous membranes, eyes. Common in tropical/subtropical areas, after flooding, in occupations with animal contact (farm workers, miners, veterinarians).</p><h3>Clinical Presentation (Biphasic)</h3><p><strong>Leptospiremic phase (Days 1-7):</strong> Fever, headache, myalgia, chills. <strong>Immune phase (Days 8-30+):</strong> Fever defervesces, then meningitis symptoms (headache, stiff neck, altered mental status), liver injury (jaundice), kidney injury (oliguria), pulmonary hemorrhage. Severe form (Weil's disease): jaundice, renal failure, hemorrhagic manifestations, mortality 5-15%.</p><h3>Diagnosis and Treatment</h3><p>Diagnosis: serology (antibodies after 5-7 days), blood culture (first week), PCR if available. Treatment: doxycycline (100mg BID) if mild and early (within 5-7 days); levofloxacin (500mg daily) alternative. Severe: IV ceftriaxone or penicillin G. Supportive: fluid management (careful with renal failure), treating complications (kidney support if needed). Prognosis: mild cases resolve; severe cases have high mortality if untreated.</p><h3>Prevention</h3><p>Avoid contaminated water (especially floodwaters), maintain rodent control (reduce reservoir), wear protective footwear in high-risk areas, treat water (boiling, chlorination). In survival: avoid open water sources if rodent activity high, cover cuts before water exposure.</p></section><section id=brucellosis><h2>Brucellosis</h2><h3>Transmission</h3><p>Transmission: contact with infected animals/products (unpasteurized dairy, undercooked meat, placental tissue from infected animals). Occupations: herders, slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians, farmers. Incubation: 1-8 weeks variable.</p><h3>Clinical Features</h3><p>Fever (often undulating—rises and falls cyclically), night sweats, fatigue, malaise, headache, myalgia. Chronic brucellosis: arthralgia (especially knees, hips, shoulders), depression, relapsing fever pattern. Diagnosis: serology, blood culture (can be slow-growing). Treatment: doxycycline (100mg BID x 6 weeks) PLUS rifampin (600mg daily x 6 weeks) for systemic infection. In acute: fluids, fever management, NSAIDs for pain.</p><h3>Chronic Disease Management</h3><p>Some patients develop chronic form (chronic fatigue, arthralgia, depression) lasting months to years. Requires prolonged antibiotic courses, supportive care, psychological support. Prognosis: generally good if treated early; chronic form more difficult.</p></section><section id=anthrax><h2>Anthrax</h2><h3>Anthrax Routes and Presentations</h3><p><strong>Cutaneous (skin):</strong> Most common (95% of natural cases). Black necrotic eschar (hence "anthrax"), painless, surrounded by edema. <strong>Pulmonary (inhalation):</strong> Severe; initial flu-like symptoms progressing to respiratory distress, mediastinal widening, shock, high mortality (>50% untreated). <strong>Gastrointestinal:</strong> Diarrhea, abdominal pain, high mortality if untreated.</p><h3>Treatment</h3><p>Cutaneous: ciprofloxacin (500mg BID x 7-10 days) or doxycycline (100mg BID x 7-10 days). Pulmonary/systemic: IV antimicrobials (ciprofloxacin, doxycycline) + supportive care. Early treatment critical (cure rate >90% for cutaneous if treated promptly). Vaccination available (for high-risk persons); no vaccine for post-exposure usually (antibiotics sufficient for PEP).</p><h3>Biosafety Concerns</h3><p>Anthrax spores highly stable in environment; contaminated soil remains infectious for decades. In survival scenario with animal exposure: assume zoonotic source, treat with respect, proper decontamination/burial of animal remains. Natural anthrax transmission rare in developed countries; most concern post-collapse era from environmental spores.</p></section><section id=tick-borne><h2>Tick-Borne Zoonotic Diseases</h2><h3>Lyme Disease (Borrelia burgdorferi)</h3><p>Transmission: Ixodes tick (small, difficult to detect). Symptoms: erythema migrans (expanding red rash from tick site, classic bullseye appearance), fever, arthralgia, Bell's palsy, carditis possible. Diagnosis: serology (late stage), culture (early, rare), PCR. Treatment: doxycycline (100mg BID x 14-21 days early stage) or amoxicillin if pregnant/pediatric. Late stage (arthritis, carditis): longer courses (28 days) or IV ceftriaxone if severe.</p><h3>Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (R. rickettsii)</h3><p>Transmission: American dog tick or wood tick. Symptoms: sudden fever, headache (severe), myalgia, rash (initially macular, becomes petechial, classic on palms/soles). Mortality: 20% untreated. Diagnosis: serology, immunostain of rash. Treatment: doxycycline (100mg BID) IMMEDIATELY if suspected (do NOT wait for confirmation). Prognosis: excellent if treated early; mortality increases with delays.</p><h3>Tick Fever (Q Fever)</h3><p>Transmission: Coxiella burnetii (highly infectious, respiratory droplets or animal contact). Acute: fever, headache, fatigue, pneumonia. Chronic: endocarditis (in patients with valvular disease), high mortality if untreated. Diagnosis: serology, PCR. Treatment: doxycycline + fluoroquinolone (for chronic Q fever). Prevention: tick avoidance crucial (vaccine available for occupations at high-risk).</p><h3>Tick Bite Prevention</h3><p>Wear long sleeves/pants in brush, use insect repellent (DEET 20-30%), perform daily body checks (ticks often crawl for hours before attaching), remove ticks correctly: grasp close to skin with tweezers, pull straight out (don't twist/crush—risks releasing pathogen into bite).</p></section><section id=prevention><h2>Prevention Strategies</h2><h3>Animal Contact Precautions</h3><ul><li>Avoid contact with wild animals; use barriers (gloves, clothing)<li>When handling domestic animals: use care, watch for illness signs<li>Hunting/butchering: wear gloves, wash hands, cook meat thoroughly<li>Avoid bites/scratches; treat any wound immediately (wash, disinfect)<li>Educate children: no wild animal contact, report unusual animal behavior</ul><h3>Waterborne Transmission Prevention</h3><p>Boil water from potentially contaminated sources (leptospirosis, giardia from wildlife), avoid swimming in flood-affected areas (leptospirosis risk), protect water supplies from animal contamination (cover well, fence off livestock), maintain sanitation distance from water (prevent animal waste runoff).</p><h3>Meat and Dairy Safety</h3><p>Cook meat thoroughly (internal temperature 165°F/74°C minimum), avoid unpasteurized dairy (brucellosis, tuberculosis), proper butchering hygiene (separate cutting surfaces, hand washing, no cross-contamination), store meat properly (cold chain maintained).</p></section><section id=exposure-response><h2>Post-Exposure Response Protocol</h2><h3>Immediate Actions After Exposure</h3><ol><li>Wash wound aggressively with soap and water (removes surface pathogens)<li>Determine exposure type: bite, scratch, mucous membrane exposure<li>Identify animal (species, if possible capture for observation)<li>Consider which zoonotic diseases relevant (geography, animal type, symptoms if any)<li>Assess need for rabies PEP (high-risk animal, significant exposure)<li>Assess need for other prophylaxis/treatment (depends on disease risk)</ol><h3>Rabies PEP Timeline</h3><p>Administer as soon as possible after exposure. Efficacy drops significantly if delayed >24 hours. Beyond 10-14 days: questionable benefit (disease may already incubating). In survival scenario: treat immediately if animal bite/exposure (do not delay waiting for confirmation). Rabies PEP unlikely harmful if given unnecessarily; risk of NOT treating when indicated is 100% mortality.</p><h3>Prophylaxis Decision Tree</h3><p><strong>High-risk animal bite (dog, bat, raccoon):</strong> Rabies PEP. <strong>Unknown animal/no animal available:</strong> Rabies PEP (err on side of caution). <strong>Animal observation possible:</strong> Keep animal under observation 10 days; if no symptoms, rabies unlikely (but some risk remains). <strong>Known healthy animal:</strong> Wounds still treated (standard precautions), rabies PEP not necessary if documented healthy.</p></section><section id=safety><div class=warning><h3>Critical Zoonotic Disease Warnings</h3><ul><li>Rabies exposure = medical emergency. PEP must begin immediately; delay >24 hours significantly reduces efficacy. Once symptomatic, essentially 100% fatal—prevention is critical.<li>Anthrax inhalation = severe respiratory disease with high mortality. Early treatment (within days) critical; delay = likely death.<li>Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever = mortality 20% untreated. Do NOT wait for serological confirmation; treat immediately if clinical suspicion and risk area.<li>Anthrax bioterrorism concern = in post-collapse scenario, environmental anthrax spores could pose risk. Proper environmental decontamination essential.</ul></div></section><section id=mistakes><div class=mistakes><h3>Common Zoonotic Disease Errors</h3><ul><li><strong>Delayed rabies PEP:</strong> Even small delays reduce efficacy; give immediately after bite.<li><strong>Improper tick removal:</strong> Crushing tick spreads infection; remove with tweezers, don't squeeze.<li><strong>Ignoring flu-like illness after animal exposure:</strong> Could indicate zoonotic disease; assume risk and monitor/treat.<li><strong>Underestimating chronic disease:</strong> Some zoonotic infections cause chronic symptoms; long-term antibiotic courses may be needed.<li><strong>Contact spread assumption:</strong> Most zoonotic diseases NOT person-to-person; isolation not needed (except plague, if pneumonic). Focus on contact precautions with infected animals/tissues.</ul></div></section><div class=related role="navigation" aria-label="Related guides"><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href=infectious-disease.html>Infectious Diseases</a> • <a href=medications.html>Essential Medications</a> • <a href=infection-control.html>Infection Control</a> • <a href=toxicology.html>Toxicology</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
