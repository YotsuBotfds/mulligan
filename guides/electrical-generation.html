Faraday's law: induced voltage = -dΦ/dt (flux change over time). Torque required to turn generator increases with electrical load: Mechanical input power = Electrical output power / Efficiency. Typical efficiency 80-95% depending on design and load.</p><h3>Generator Types & Characteristics</h3><p><strong>AC Generator (Alternator):</strong> Output voltage proportional to rotation speed. No commutator needed. Output is sinusoidal at mains frequency (50/60 Hz) if connected to grid. Needs voltage regulation for varying loads. Rotor can be permanent magnet or electromagnet (excited field). AC generators with capacitor self-excitation work stand-alone without external power.</p><p><strong>DC Generator:</strong> Brushes and commutator convert AC output to DC. Output proportional to RPM and field current. Field can be separately excited (constant voltage) or self-excited (varies with load). DC generators deliver steady voltage but require commutator maintenance. Ideal for battery charging applications.</p><h3>Alternator SVG</h3><svg viewbox='0 0 500 400' xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="background:#2d2416" aria-label='Power Generation diagram 1'><defs><lineargradient id="magnGrad" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="0%" y2="100%"><stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#d4a574;stop-opacity:1"></stop><stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#8b7355;stop-opacity:1"></stop></lineargradient></defs><circle cx="250" cy="200" r="180" fill="none" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2"></circle><circle cx="250" cy="200" r="160" fill="#1a2e1a" opacity="0.5"></circle><rect x="70" y="120" width="50" height="160" fill="url(#magnGrad)" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2"></rect><text x="72" y="210" font-size="12" fill="#f5f0e8">N</text><rect x="380" y="120" width="50" height="160" fill="#6b5344" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2"></rect><text x="390" y="210" font-size="12" fill="#f5f0e8">S</text><circle cx="250" cy="200" r="80" fill="none" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="3"></circle><path d='M 250 120 Q 310 160 310 200 Q 310 240 250 280' fill="none" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="2"></path><path d='M 250 120 Q 190 160 190 200 Q 190 240 250 280' fill="none" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="2"></path><circle cx="250" cy="200" r="6" fill="#d4a574"></circle><line x1="250" y1="194" x2="250" y2="206" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2"></line><line x1="244" y1="200" x2="256" y2="200" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2"></line><text x="200" y="365" font-size="12" fill="#d4a574" font-weight="bold">Rotor coil rotates in stator magnetic field</text><text x="280" y="385" font-size="12" fill="#d4a574" font-weight="bold">inducing AC voltage</text></svg><h3>Output Voltage & Load</h3><p>AC generator terminal voltage depends on: (1) Rotor speed (RPM), (2) Magnetic field strength (flux), (3) Number of turns in coil, (4) Load current (causes voltage drop). No-load voltage may be 250V, but at full load with poor regulation, might drop to 200V. Good voltage regulation holds output within 5% of rated voltage over full load range.</p><h3>Frequency & Speed Relationship</h3><p>For AC generators connected to grid or phase-locked system: Frequency = (Speed × Poles) / 120. A 60 Hz generator needs: 2-pole at 3600 RPM, 4-pole at 1800 RPM, 6-pole at 1200 RPM. Portable generators typically run 2-pole at 3600 RPM for compact size, though this causes higher vibration than slower-speed designs.</p></section><section id="dynamos"><h2>Dynamos & DC Generation</h2><h3>Homopolar Dynamo</h3><p>Simplest DC generator: rotating conducting disk in perpendicular magnetic field. Current flows radially from center to edge. No commutator needed. Output voltage = (B × ω × r²) / 2, where B is magnetic field, ω is angular velocity, r is disk radius. Very low voltage (millivolts), high current (amperes) design. Useful for physics demonstrations and low-voltage applications.</p><h3>DC Commutator Dynamo</h3><p>Standard DC generator with rotating armature coil and commutator. Output voltage proportional to: (1) Magnetic flux density in air gap, (2) Number of coil turns, (3) RPM. Voltage regulation achieved by adjusting field excitation current. Self-excited dynamo uses portion of output current to maintain field—requires minimum speed to start self-excitation.</p><h3>Shunt vs Series Excitation</h3><p><strong>Shunt-excited:</strong> Field coil connected in parallel with load. Provides relatively constant voltage (within 15-20% over full load range) and is stable. Used for most power generation applications where constant voltage is desired.</p><p><strong>Series-excited:</strong> Field coil in series with load. Voltage increases with load current. Provides good voltage at heavy loads but poor regulation. Useful for battery charging (natural current limiting) and constant-current applications.</p><h3>Compound-Excited</h3><p>Both shunt and series fields present. Shunt field provides base voltage regulation; series field boosts voltage under load. Best of both worlds: stable voltage with load-dependent adjustment. Used in older diesel generators and street-light charging systems.</p></section><section id="wind"><h2>Wind Turbine Construction</h2><h3>Practical Wind Turbine Basics</h3><p>Wind turbines convert kinetic energy from wind into rotational mechanical energy, then into electricity. Power available in wind = 0.5 × ρ × A × V³, where ρ is air density (1.225 kg/m³), A is swept area, V is wind speed. Doubling wind speed increases power 8×. Small turbine at 10 m/s and 1 m² blade area yields approximately 610W in ideal conditions, accounting for typical 35% efficiency.</p><h3>Blade Design Principles</h3><p>Blade shape (airfoil) creates lift force perpendicular to wind flow. Blade area swept through one revolution must be reasonable size—typical home turbine 2-5 meter diameter blades. Blade pitch (angle of attack) affects efficiency; typical 15-25 degrees. Variable-pitch blades automatically adjust angle to maintain constant RPM as wind speed changes.</p><h3>Rotor Speed & Gearing</h3><p>Small wind turbines operate 60-500 RPM depending on blade size. Direct-drive generators (rare) spin at turbine RPM. More common: gearbox steps up to 1500-3600 RPM for AC generator or permanent magnet generator. Gearing losses typically 3-5%. Gear ratio = Generator RPM / Turbine RPM. A 100 RPM turbine with 3600 RPM generator needs 36:1 gearing.</p><h3>Yaw Control & Tail</h3><p>Horizontal-axis wind turbine needs mechanism to point into wind. Small turbines use simple vane tail to orient automatically. Larger machines need active yaw motors. Vertical-axis turbines (Darrieus type) accept wind from any direction but are less efficient and harder to service.</p><h3>Furling & Overspeed Protection</h3><p>Without speed control, turbine accelerates to dangerous speeds in high wind. Options: (1) Mechanical furling: tail side-mounts and twists turbine away from strong wind. (2) Pitch control: blades twist to reduce angle of attack. (3) Electrical load increases with speed, naturally limiting RPM. (4) Braking system shuts down turbine in extreme wind.</p></section><section id="microhydro"><h2>Micro-Hydro Systems</h2><h3>Head, Flow, & Power Calculation</h3><p>Hydroelectric power depends on: Power (W) = 9800 × Flow (m³/s) × Head (m) × Efficiency. "Head" is vertical drop from intake to generator (not pipe length). A stream with 2 m³/s flow and 10 m head yields 196 kW theoretical power. Typical efficiency 60-80% depending on system quality. Even small streams with modest head can produce useful power.</p><h3>Turbine Types for Micro-Hydro</h3><p><strong>Pelton wheel:</strong> Best for high head (>20m), low flow. Free-jet design hits buckets. Efficiency 80-90%. Self-regulating; excess water spills to load-chamber without energy loss.</p><p><strong>Turgo wheel:</strong> Medium head (10-30m), medium flow. Similar to Pelton but more compact. Crossflow enters one side, exits opposite side.</p><p><strong>Francis turbine:</strong> Medium head (5-20m), large flow. Runner blades direct water spiral inward and outward. High efficiency 85-90% when properly designed. Most common commercial hydroelectric.</p><p><strong>Crossflow (Banki):</strong> Very low head (1-10m), high flow. Water crosses turbine twice, simple construction. Efficiency 60-75%. Easy to build by hand from PVC or metal.</p><p><strong>Screw generator:</strong> Archimedean screw turned by flowing water. Very low head. Simple, fish-friendly. Efficiency 60-75%. Recently developed for micro-hydro.</p></section><section id="solar"><h2>Solar Basics</h2><h3>Photovoltaic Effect & Panel Types</h3><p>Solar panels convert photons directly to electrons through photovoltaic effect in semiconductor junction. Monocrystalline panels: highest efficiency (18-22%) but expensive. Polycrystalline: moderate efficiency (15-18%), lower cost. Thin-film: lowest efficiency (10-13%) but flexible and lightweight. Panel output rated in watts under standard test conditions (1000 W/m² sunlight, 25°C).</p><h3>Voltage & Current Characteristics</h3><p>Typical panel produces ~37V open circuit, ~30V at rated power point. Current depends on panel size: 6 watt panel produces ~0.2A, 400W panel produces ~10A at rated power. String multiple panels in series for higher voltage (add voltages), parallel for higher current (add currents). Series-parallel combinations achieve desired voltage and current.</p><h3>Maximum Power Point Tracking</h3><p>Solar panel power output varies with voltage. Peak power occurs at specific voltage depending on load. MPPT charge controller adjusts internal switching to track peak power point, increasing harvest by 20-30% vs fixed voltage charging. Essential for efficient battery charging from solar panels.</p><h3>Temperature Effects</h3><p>Panel efficiency decreases with temperature: approximately -0.5% per degree Celsius above 25°C. A hot panel at 60°C produces 17.5% less power than nameplate rating. Heat dissipation critical in sunny climates; allow airflow under mounted panels. Cold panels actually work better than rated (up to +2% efficiency increase).</p></section><section id="regulation"><h2>Voltage Regulation</h2><h3>Load Resistance & Voltage Sag</h3><p>Generator terminal voltage drops under load due to internal resistance and armature reaction. Generator with 2Ω internal resistance and 50A load: voltage drop = 50 × 2 = 100V. A 240V generator supplying 50A sees terminal voltage drop to 140V without regulation. Load resistance method: fixed shunt resistance (rheostatic control) dissipates excess power but wastes energy.</p><h3>Voltage Regulation Circuits</h3><p><strong>Field Current Control (Excitation):</strong> Varying the DC current through rotor field coil adjusts magnetic flux, varying output voltage. Electronic regulator senses output voltage and adjusts field current automatically. Very efficient. Most common method for AC and DC generators.</p><p><strong>Rectifier Control:</strong> For AC generators, rectifier bridge voltage varies with average current. Tapped secondary winding and variable switching provide regulation. Brushless alternators use rotating rectifier on rotor, eliminating slip rings and brushes.</p><h3>Load-Share Paralleling</h3><p>Parallel-connecting multiple generators requires synchronization: same frequency and voltage, <30° phase angle difference. Droop load-sharing: each generator droops voltage slightly with load (4-6% droop). Generator delivering more current has proportionally more voltage sag, naturally balancing load. Frequency-droop paralleling uses same principle for frequency control.</p><h3>Battery Charging Regulators</h3><p>Two-stage regulation common: constant-current stage charges battery quickly (bulk charge), then constant-voltage stage maintains charge as battery approaches full. Voltage setting typically 13.8V for 12V battery (1.15× nominal). Charge current limited by battery capacity (C/10 rate for lead-acid, 1C safe for lithium) and generator power.</p></section><section id="circuits"><h2>Charging Circuits & Rectification</h2><h3>AC to DC Rectification</h3><p>Half-wave rectifier: single diode conducts every other half-cycle, blocking reverse current. Output is pulsating DC with large ripple (48% ripple voltage). Full-wave bridge: four diodes, conducting on each half-cycle. Output has smaller ripple (4% at 60 Hz). Center-tap transformer alternative uses two diodes but requires transformer with center tap.</p><h3>Smoothing & Filtering</h3><p>Capacitive filter (large capacitor across output) charges during each conducted pulse, discharges through load between pulses. Larger capacitor = lower ripple voltage. Rule of thumb: 2-4 µF per amp of output current. Inductive filter (choke in series) smooths current ripple. LC filter combines capacitive and inductive to achieve both voltage and current smoothing.</p><h3>Diode Selection</h3><p>Diode peak reverse voltage (PRV) rating must exceed peak AC voltage × 1.4. For 120V AC: peak = 170V, so 400V+ diodes needed. Current rating must handle peak current, which for capacitor-input filter is 3-5× RMS current. Use fast-recovery diodes (1-5 µs) for smooth power supplies; slow-recovery acceptable for power supplies <10 kHz ripple frequency.</p><h3>Transformer Sizing</h3><p>Transformer secondary voltage must be peak voltage of rectifier output plus 2-3V for diode drops. For 24V DC output, secondary needs 17-18V. Current rating must handle RMS current to secondary (typically 1.5-2× DC output current due to diode conduction angle). Transformer losses typically 5-8%; efficiency improves with larger core.</p></section><section id="efficiency"><h2>Efficiency & Optimization</h2><h3>System Losses Accounting</h3><p>Typical generator system efficiency breakdown: Generator 85-95%, Transmission (wiring) 2-5% loss, Rectifier (if needed) 1-3%, Filter/regulation circuits 1-2%, Battery charging 5-10%. Total system efficiency 65-85% depending on components. Improving any single component cascades to overall improvement.</p><h3>Mechanical Losses in Rotating Machinery</h3><p>Bearing friction: typically 1-2% power loss in well-maintained equipment. Windage losses (air friction on rotor): 1-3% at high speed. Cogging losses (magnetic resistance as rotor turns): 0.5-1%. Total mechanical loss typically 2-5%, with smaller machines having higher percentage losses.</p><h3>Electrical Losses</h3><p>I²R loss in windings: Heat = I² × R. Copper resistance increases with temperature. At 75°C operation vs 25°C, resistance increases ~20%, affecting efficiency. Doubling current quadruples I²R loss, making proper wire sizing essential. Core losses (hysteresis and eddy currents) typically 1-3% in modern steel, higher in older machines.</p><h3>Optimization Strategies</h3><p>Match generator size to typical load: oversized generators run at low efficiency. Use step-up gearing to run generator at optimal RPM (usually 1500-3600 RPM for alternators). Minimize transmission wiring—voltage drop losses increase with resistance and current squared. Use MPPT for solar systems. Regular maintenance—clean air filter, change oil, inspect bearings.</p></section><section id="storage"><h2>Energy Storage & Management</h2><h3>Battery Selection for Off-Grid Systems</h3><p><strong>Lead-acid:</strong> Inexpensive, reliable, 80-90% charge efficiency. Capacity reduces at low temperature and high discharge rate. Lifespan 3-7 years with proper maintenance (regular watering and charging).</p><p><strong>Lithium:</strong> Higher cost, 95%+ efficiency, excellent low-temperature performance. Lifespan 10+ years. Requires active management circuit (BMS). Better for intermittent use systems (solar).</p><p><strong>Nickel-metal hydride:</strong> Good performance, reasonable cost. Slower charging than lithium. Hysteresis effect (efficiency depends on charge/discharge history) requires careful charging profiles.</p><h3>Charge Rate & Battery Sizing</h3><p>Battery capacity = Hours of autonomy × Average load current. A system needing 24 hours autonomy with 10A average load needs 240 Ah battery (for lead-acid, size 1.3× for depth-of-discharge considerations = 312 Ah). Charge time = Battery capacity (Ah) / Charge current (A). A 100A charge current charges 312 Ah battery in 3 hours theoretical, 4-5 hours practical (accounting for voltage rise and reduced current near full charge).</p><h3>System Management Electronics</h3><p>Charge controller: regulates generator/solar input to battery voltage and current limits. Inverter: converts DC battery to AC mains voltage for AC appliances (typically 20-30% loss). DC-DC converter: steps voltage up or down for different circuit voltages. Smart monitoring: measures power flow, battery state-of-charge, calculates autonomy remaining.</p></section><div class="warning"><strong>Safety Warning:</strong> High-voltage rotating equipment can cause severe injury. Guard all rotating shafts and couplings. Generators produce carbon monoxide when fuel-powered—never operate indoors. Electrical shock hazard from high-voltage alternators and inverters—verify isolation before touching. Battery systems store enormous energy and can cause welding-arc burns if shorted accidentally.</div><div class="tip"><strong>Efficiency Tip:</strong> Small generators and alternators are often oversized for typical loads, reducing efficiency. Consider using smaller unit for base load with larger unit available for peak demands.
