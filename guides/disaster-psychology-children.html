The core principle: <strong>children are not small adults.</strong> Their developmental stage, coping mechanisms, and communication styles require specialized approaches.</p><p>The five pillars of Pediatric PFA are <strong>Safety</strong> (physical and emotional), <strong>Calm</strong> (managing arousal and panic), <strong>Connection</strong> (maintaining and restoring relationships), <strong>Competence</strong> (rebuilding agency and capability), and <strong>Hope</strong> (restoring belief in future).</p><p>A child experiencing disaster needs to know: "I am safe. Someone is taking care of this. I can help. We will get through this together. Things will be okay."</p></section><section id=age-specific><h2>Age-Specific Interventions</h2><p><strong>Infants and Toddlers (0-3 years):</strong> Cannot understand language explanation. They respond to physical contact, comfort objects (blankets, toys), familiar routines, and calming tone. Hold, rock, and provide consistent care. Reunite with attachment figures immediately if possible.</p><p><strong>Preschool (3-6 years):</strong> Use simple, concrete language. Avoid scary details. Drawing and coloring help process emotions non-verbally. Reassure about parent reunification. Maintain familiar routines as much as possible.</p><p><strong>School Age (6-12 years):</strong> Ask open-ended questions about feelings and experiences. Provide specific information about safety and community response. Assign helping roles ("Can you help organize supplies?"). Maintain peer connection and normalcy where possible.</p><p><strong>Adolescents (12-18 years):</strong> Respect their growing autonomy. Provide factual information. Recognize that they may feel responsible or angry. Facilitate peer support and community contribution. Address identity and future concerns seriously.</p></section><section id=play-processing><h2>Play-Based Processing</h2><p><strong>Unstructured Play:</strong> Allow free play without direction. Children process trauma and stress through play naturally. Provide safe space and materials.</p><p><strong>Storytelling and Narrative:</strong> Have children tell the story of their experience multiple times. Verbal processing helps integrate trauma and reduces intrusive memories. Don't force details, but allow elaboration.</p><p><strong>Group Games:</strong> Structured group activities restore sense of normalcy and connection. Games build trust and allow safe interaction with peers.</p><p><strong>Music and Movement:</strong> Singing, dancing, and physical activity discharge tension and anxiety. These activities are non-verbal and culturally appropriate across most settings.</p><p><strong>Puppet and Role Play:</strong> Children can express difficult feelings through puppets or role-play that they cannot verbalize directly. This creates emotional distance while allowing processing.</p></section><section id=routine-restoration><h2>Routine Restoration</h2><p>Routine matters profoundly. Predictable structure signals that the world is safe and that adults are in control. Routine reduces anxiety and aids emotional regulation in children.</p><p><strong>Daily Schedule:</strong> Establish a visual daily schedule (with pictures if needed). Include mealtimes, sleep, schoolwork, play, and work contributions. Consistency is more important than rigidity.</p><p><strong>Bedtime Ritual:</strong> This is the most important daily routine. Children's anxiety peaks at bedtime. Consistent bedtime ritual (stories, songs, physical contact) reduces sleep problems and nightmares. Invest significant effort here.</p><p><strong>Meals Together:</strong> Family meals provide structure, connection, and reassurance. Eating together signals normalcy and safety. Prioritize this even in resource-limited situations.</p><p>Gradually restore additional routines—school, chores, recreation—as stability increases. Each routine restored reduces anxiety and restores sense of agency.</p></section><section id=when-to-seek-help><h2>When to Seek Additional Help</h2><p><strong>Normal Recovery:</strong> Most children recover from disaster-related stress within 4-6 weeks with consistent support, routine, and connection. Mild anxiety, sleep disruption, and emotional sensitivity are expected and typically resolve naturally.</p><p><strong>Concerning Signs:</strong> Persistent or worsening symptoms beyond 6 weeks warrant additional attention. Self-harm, complete withdrawal from peers, refusal to eat or speak, persistent nightmares, or ongoing dissociation are red flags.</p><p><strong>Referral Process:</strong> In situations without professional mental health services, identify an empathic community member—teacher, nurse, respected elder—who can provide ongoing support and observation. Regular check-ins with a trusted adult often suffice for recovery.</p><p>Avoid labeling children as "traumatized" or "damaged." Most children are resilient. Normalize the experience: "You went through something scary. Your feelings make sense. Many people feel this way. You will feel better." Provide hope alongside acknowledgment.</p></section><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium &mdash; Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
