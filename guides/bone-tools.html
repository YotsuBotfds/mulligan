Different bones suit different purposes; understanding bone anatomy optimizes material selection.</p><h3>Bone Structure & Properties:</h3><ul><li><strong>Cortex (outer dense layer):</strong> Hard, white, excellent for tools requiring sharp edges. Thicker cortex in weight-bearing bones (femur, tibia).</li><li><strong>Cancellous (inner spongy material):</strong> Lighter, weaker, used for items requiring flexibility or low density.</li><li><strong>Marrow cavity:</strong> Hollow center in large bones; can be used to create tubes (flutes, hollow tools).</li></ul><h3>Bone Selection by Tool Type:</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Bone Type</th><th scope="row">Characteristics</th><th scope="row">Best Uses</th></tr><tr><td>Femur (leg bone)</td><td>Large, dense, strong</td><td>Harpoon points, large scrapers, handles</td></tr><tr><td>Radius/Ulna (forearm)</td><td>Medium, manageable size</td><td>Awls, hooks, fish spears</td></tr><tr><td>Ribs</td><td>Curved, flexible, thin-walled</td><td>Flexible tools, harpoon shafts, knife handles</li></tr><tr><td>Antler</td><td>Very hard, branching structure</td><td>Tines, hooks, hammers, specialized points</td></tr><tr><td>Small bones (bird, small mammal)</td><td>Fine detail possible, brittle</td><td>Fine needles, hooks, specialized points</td></tr></table><h3>Source & Preparation:</h3><p>Bone fresh from butchering is workable; aged bone (2+ weeks) is harder but more brittle. Boiling bone removes marrow and softens outer layer (easier initial shaping). Dried bone is most workable (clean and stable).</p></section><section id="preparation"><h2>Bone Preparation</h2><h3>Cleaning:</h3><p>Remove all meat and tissue from bone. Soak in water 24+ hours to facilitate cleaning. Scrub with stone or bone tool to remove remaining tissue. Boil 1-2 hours to soften remaining material and denature protein (prevents rot). Allow to dry completely before working (moisture prevents clean breaking).</p><h3>Straightening Warped Bone:</h3><p>Heat bone gently (near fire, not in flames); bone becomes plastic and can be bent. Hold in desired position until cool. Repeated heating cycles may be needed for severely warped bone. Risk: excessive heat burns bone (turns black and becomes brittle).</p><h3>Splitting Large Bones:</h3><p>Create shallow groove along bone using flaked or ground stone tool. Work groove gradually deeper (requires patience; rushing causes uncontrolled fracture). Once groove is 1-2mm deep, tap carefully with stone hammer; bone splits along groove. Practice on non-critical bone first.</p></section><section id="shaping"><h2>Shaping Techniques</h2><h3>Grinding:</h3><p>Rough stone (sandstone, granite) used to grind bone to shape. Circular grinding motion against stone surface gradually removes material. Effective for creating flat edges, rounded profiles, and precise shapes. Time-intensive: 2-5 minutes per centimeter of edge. Produces smooth finish suitable for final tool.</p><h3>Flaking (Percussion Flaking):</h3><p>Strike bone edge with precisely positioned stone hammer. Bone breaks along grain; small flakes remove. Similar to stone flaking but bone structure more predictable. Results in sharp edges (sharper than stone). Requires skill to direct breaks.</p><h3>Sawing:</h3><p>Use finer stone saw or bone saw (see cordage guide for cutting cord) to cut bone perpendicular to grain. Creates clean cuts; less material loss than percussion flaking. Time-intensive but allows precise sizing.</p><h3>Engraving & Detail Work:</h3><p>Fine stone point or bone point used to scratch designs or create holes. Effective for decorative elements, anatomical accuracy, or functional details (eye grooves on harpoon heads, barbs on hooks).</p></section><section id="awls"><h2>Awl Making</h2><p>Awls are pointed tools for puncturing material (leather, hide, sinew). Most fundamental bone tool; useful for all crafts.</p><h3>Design:</h3><ul><li><strong>Length:</strong> 10-15cm (longer awls difficult to control)</li><li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 5-8mm at handle, tapering to 2-3mm at point</li><li><strong>Point:</strong> Fine taper (5-10cm) creates clean holes without tearing</li><li><strong>Handle:</strong> Thicker section (8-10mm diameter) for gripping</li></ul><h3>Construction Steps:</h3><ol><li>Select bone or antler fragment suitable for awl diameter</li><li>Shape point by grinding against rough stone (creates gradual taper)</li><li>Sharpen tip using fine stone (small circular grinding motions)</li><li>Create handle from thicker section (optional: wrap with cordage for grip)</li><li>Test by puncturing leather or hide (should pierce easily without force)</li></ol><h3>Specialized Awl Types:</h3><p><strong>Blunt awl:</strong> For stretching rather than puncturing; used to open holes in woven material without cutting fibers. Created by rounding tip rather than sharpening.</p><p><strong>Curved awl:</strong> Follows natural curve of rib bone. Useful for round materials. More difficult to control but natural curvature assists work.</p></section><section id="needles"><h2>Needle & Harpoon Point Making</h2><h3>Needle Characteristics:</h3><ul><li><strong>Length:</strong> 3-5cm (small bone tools most effective)</li><li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 2-3mm allowing passage through hide/cloth</li><li><strong>Eye:</strong> Hole at upper end through which sinew or plant fiber thread passes</li><li><strong>Point:</strong> Fine taper or slightly flattened for ease of pushing through material</li></ul><h3>Needle Construction:</h3><ol><li>Select small bone or fish bone (natural tubular shape ideal)</li><li>Create point by gradual grinding (rounded tip prevents splitting material)</li><li>Create eye hole by careful percussion flaking or grinding (opposite end from point)</li><li>Smooth all surfaces with fine stone</li><li>Test eye hole with thread (should allow smooth passage without snagging)</li></ol><h3>Harpoon Point Making:</h3><p><strong>Design:</strong> 3-4 inches long with barbs along sides. Single or double-barbed designs. Barbs face inward preventing escape once lodged in fish/game.</p><p><strong>Construction:</strong> Carve point from bone; create barbs by careful flaking or carving. Test barb sharpness (should catch on movement in one direction, slide smoothly in other direction). Attach to shaft using sinew binding (see hafting section).</p></section><section id="scrapers"><h2>Scraper & Flaker Making</h2><h3>Scraper Design:</h3><p>Flat tool with sharp edge for scraping hide/leather. Typical: 3-4 inches long, 1 inch wide, edge sharp enough to remove hair from hide.</p><h3>Construction:</h3><ol><li>Flatten bone to 3-5mm thickness by grinding</li><li>Create sharp edge by grinding at 30-degree angle</li><li>Create handle by leaving thicker section or grinding hand grip</li><li>Test on hide: should remove hair cleanly without gouging underlying skin</li></ol><h3>Flaker Tool (For Stone Tool Making):</h3><p>Specialized bone tool for pressure flaking stone tools. Pointed bone applies directed pressure to flake stone edges. More controlled than hammer blows. Requires firm point (antler preferred for durability).</p><h3>Specialized Scrapers:</h3><ul><li><strong>Fish scaler:</strong> Rough edge breaks fish scales cleanly</li><li><strong>Bone scraper:</strong> Dulled edge for scraping without cutting (bone working)</li><li><strong>Hide scraper:</strong> Very sharp edge removes hair and tissue from hide</li></ul></section><section id="points"><h2>Projectile Point Making</h2><p>Bone points for arrows, spears, and atlatl darts. Design determines target and effectiveness. See weapon guide for application context.</p><h3>Arrow Point Design:</h3><ul><li><strong>Length:</strong> 1-2 inches</li><li><strong>Width:</strong> 1/4-1/2 inch</li><li><strong>Shape:</strong> Barbed or straight leaf shape</li><li><strong>Barbs:</strong> Small backward-facing barbs prevent withdrawal</li></ul><h3>Spear Point Design:</h3><ul><li><strong>Length:</strong> 3-6 inches</li><li><strong>Width:</strong> 1-2 inches</li><li><strong>Weight:</strong> Heavy (encourages point-forward flight)</li><li><strong>Socket:</strong> Often hafted into wooden shaft via socket attachment</li></ul><h3>Construction Process:</h3><ol><li>Select bone suitable to point type (small bone for arrow, larger for spear)</li><li>Shape point by percussion flaking or grinding</li><li>Create barbs by careful controlled flaking (angled away from point)</li><li>Sharp edge essential (dull points ineffective)</li><li>Haft socket created by grinding cone-shaped indentation</li></ol><h3>Testing:</h3><p>Point should penetrate hide easily (minimum 2 inches into fresh hide for effective hunting point). Barbs should catch without excessive damage to shaft during removal.</p></section><section id="hafting"><h2>Hafting & Assembly</h2><p>Hafting is securing tool head to handle. Quality hafting determines tool durability and effectiveness.</p><h3>Sinew Binding Method (Most Common):</h3><ol><li>Prepare sinew fibers (very fine strands, 1-2mm diameter)</li><li>Apply strong bone glue (boiled bone/hide) or resin to joint area</li><li>Wrap sinew around joint 10-20 tight wraps</li><li>Space wraps evenly (overlapping wraps provide strength)</li><li>Bind at 1/4 inch intervals for critical tools</li><li>Allow glue to dry fully (12-24 hours) before use</li></ol><h3>Socket Hafting (For Heavy Points):</h3><p>Point has conical socket; shaft end tapered to fit snugly. Sinew binding around junction secures fit. More secure than direct binding for heavy tools; permits tool replacement if handle breaks.</p><h3>Adhesive Selection:</h3><ul><li><strong>Bone glue:</strong> Boil bone/hooves 2+ hours; liquid sets when cool to rubbery gel. Very strong when dry.</li><li><strong>Hide glue:</strong> Similar process to bone glue; sourced from animal hide</li><li><strong>Plant resin:</strong> Birch bark resin, pine resin; less durable than animal glues but adequate</li></ul><h3>Hafting Angles:</h3><p>Tool head should be properly aligned with handle. Arrowheads straight; harpoon heads angled forward (10-15 degree angle improves penetration); awls angled 10-20 degrees for comfort. Test grip before finalizing hafting.</p></section><section id="common-mistakes"><h2>Common Mistakes & Solutions</h2><h3>Mistake 1: Unfinished/Dull Points</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Points left with coarse grinding marks or dulled edges. Ineffective for piercing; requires excessive force to penetrate.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Fine-grind all points using smallest stone available. Final grinding should produce smooth, shiny surface and visibly sharp edge.</p><h3>Mistake 2: Weak Hafting</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Insufficient sinew wrapping or inadequate adhesive. Tool head loosens during use; dangerous tool failure.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Wrap minimum 15-20 times; dry 24 hours. Test hafting by striking tool head perpendicular to grain (should not move). High-quality glue essential.</p><h3>Mistake 3: Poor Material Selection</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Using unsuitable bone for tool type. Brittle bone shatters during use; weak bone bends or breaks.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Understand bone types before committing to tool. Test material by attempting to break sample piece (too brittle or too weak becomes apparent).</p><h3>Mistake 4: Excessive Heat During Straightening</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Overheating bone until it chars or becomes brittle. Tool material permanently degraded.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Heat only until pliable (slightly uncomfortable to touch); cool and check straightness. Repeat with lighter heating if needed.</p></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="stone-tools.html">Stone Tool Making</a><a href="cra-07-primitive-weapons.html">Primitive Weapons</a><a href="con-02-carpentry-woodworking.html">Carpentry & Woodworking</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
