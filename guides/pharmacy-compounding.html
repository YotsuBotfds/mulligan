Standardized, quality-assured. <strong>Compounding:</strong> Preparation of custom medication doses/formulations for individual patients. Legal in survival scenarios (pharmacist typically performs in normal settings). Can adapt available medications for different routes/strengths.</p><h3>Survival Pharmacology Needs</h3><p>Limited medication availability requires: liquid formulations from tablets (for children, difficulty swallowing), higher/lower doses from available stock, alternative routes (liquid injection-grade medication from tablets), preservation of medications for extended shelf life. Compounding allows improvisation with available materials.</p><h3>Compounding Safety Rules</h3><ul><li>Aseptic technique: prevent contamination with bacteria, fungi, particles<li>Accurate measurements: pharmaceutical compounding requires precision; errors cause toxicity or inefficacy<li>Proper storage: maintain stability, prevent degradation<li>Documentation: record what was made, when, by whom, expiration<li>Training: ensure proper technique before attempting complex formulations</ul></section><section id="dosage-forms"><h2>Dosage Forms</h2><h3>Tablets and Capsules</h3><p>Solid dosage forms; portable, stable. Tablets can be crushed (if not sustained-release) for administration to those unable to swallow. Some medications enteric-coated (dissolve in intestine, not stomach); crushing destroys coating. Capsules: separate halves, mix powder with liquid/food if needed. Advantages: stable, portable, accurate dosing. Disadvantages: require swallowing, more difficult for pediatric patients.</p><h3>Liquids (Solutions and Suspensions)</h3><p><strong>Solutions:</strong> Drug dissolved in liquid (clear). <strong>Suspensions:</strong> Drug particles suspended (cloudy, requires shaking). Liquids: easier swallowing, flexible dosing, faster absorption. Disadvantages: shorter shelf life (especially suspensions), larger volume needed for same dose, require storage space. In survival: crucial for pediatric medication administration.</p><h3>Powders and Injectables</h3><p><strong>Powder:</strong> Dry form, long shelf life. Reconstitute (mix with liquid) before use. <strong>Injectables:</strong> Sterile solutions for IV/IM/SC administration. Allow bypassing GI tract (useful if GI upset/inability to swallow). Risk: infection if not sterile, needle injury. In survival: reserve for serious conditions requiring IV access.</p><h3>Topical Preparations</h3><p>Creams, ointments, gels: applied to skin/mucous membranes. Advantages: localized effect, minimal systemic absorption (lower toxicity risk), familiar preparations. Disadvantages: slower effect, limited penetration. In survival: useful for wounds, infections, inflammation where systemic effects unnecessary.</p></section><section id="basic-compounding"><h2>Basic Compounding Techniques</h2><h3>Tablet Crushing and Suspension</h3><ol><li>Identify tablet (ensure crushable, not sustained-release)<li>Perform hand hygiene, don gloves<li>Place tablet in clean cup/mortar<li>Crush with pestle or spoon handle into powder<li>Add small amount liquid (water, juice if flavor desired) to dissolve/suspend<li>Stir thoroughly to ensure even distribution<li>Draw up into syringe if volume allows, or use spoon/cup for administration<li>Administer immediately to minimize degradation</ol><h3>Powder Reconstitution</h3><p>Many medications supplied as powder (especially antibiotics) requiring reconstitution before use. Steps: 1) Read instructions (amount of liquid, type). 2) Draw up specified volume of sterile water. 3) Add to powder vial slowly while swirling (don't shake—creates bubbles). 4) Let stand 1-2 minutes for complete dissolution. 5) Label with date/time of reconstitution, expiration time (typically 7-14 days refrigerated, hours at room temp—check instructions). 6) Store appropriately.</p><h3>Dilution Calculations</h3><p>Formula: C₁V₁ = C₂V₂ (concentration₁ × volume₁ = concentration₂ × volume₂). Example: Have 500mg/5mL suspension, need 250mg. (500mg/5mL) × V₁ = (250mg) × (final volume). V₁ = 2.5mL of the 500mg/5mL suspension. Can dilute further with liquid for smaller doses.</p><h3>Solution Mixing</h3><p>For medication solutions that need dilution: use sterile water (or normal saline for injection solutions). Mix in sterile container using sterile technique. For liquids requiring compounding (flavor, preservation): use clean containers, measure accurately, mix thoroughly. Label immediately with contents, concentration, date prepared.</p></section><section id="measurements"><h2>Measurements and Calculations</h2><h3>Metric System (Standard)</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Unit<th scope="row">Abbreviation<th scope="row">Equivalent<tr><td>Kilogram<td>kg<td>1000g<tr><td>Gram<td>g<td>1000mg<tr><td>Milligram<td>mg<td>1000mcg (or µg)<tr><td>Microgram<td>mcg<td>0.001mg<tr><td>Liter<td>L<td>1000mL<tr><td>Milliliter<td>mL<td>1mL (1 cubic cm)</table><h3>Volume Measurement</h3><p>Syringes (1mL, 3mL, 5mL, 10mL common): mark in mL or sometimes in minims (older). For accuracy: use smallest syringe that accommodates dose (1mL syringe more accurate for small volumes than 10mL). Spoons: unreliable (vary in size); use measuring spoons (teaspoon = 5mL, tablespoon = 15mL) if syringes unavailable.</p><h3>Concentration Calculations</h3><p>Percent solutions: % w/w (weight/weight) = grams solute/100g total. % w/v (weight/volume) = grams solute/100mL total. % v/v (volume/volume) = mL solute/100mL total. Example: 5% solution means 5g in 100mL for w/v, or 5mL in 100mL for v/v.</p><h3>Dose Calculation Example</h3><p>Patient weighs 70kg, needs amoxicillin 25mg/kg. Total dose = 25mg/kg × 70kg = 1750mg. Divided into 3 doses = 583mg per dose (or round to 600mg). If have 500mg tablets = give 1.2 tablets (or 1 tablet + 1/5 tablet by crushing and dividing).</p></section><section id="solutions"><h2>Solutions and Suspensions</h2><h3>Saline Solution (for injection/irrigation)</h3><p>Sterile normal saline: 0.9% sodium chloride (9g NaCl in 1L sterile water). For: IV fluids, wound irrigation, inhalation. Preparation: dissolve 9g NaCl in 1L sterile water, autoclave or filter-sterilize. In survival: boil and cool water, dissolve salt (ratio: 1/2 teaspoon salt per 8 oz water approximates 0.85%, acceptable alternative).</p><h3>Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS)</h3><p>Critical for diarrheal illness. WHO formula: 1L water + 6 teaspoons sugar + 1/2 teaspoon salt (sodium chloride) + 1/2 teaspoon potassium chloride (if available, otherwise omit). Mix thoroughly. Can substitute: coconut water (natural electrolytes), broth with added sugar/salt. Administer: sips frequently (small amounts tolerated better than large volumes). Continue until diarrhea stops.</p><h3>Suspension Stability</h3><p>Particles settle over time; requires shaking before each use. Shelf life reduced compared to solutions (particles may cake, become difficult to resuspend). Preservatives added (in commercial preparations) prevent microbial growth; without preservatives, must use within hours (room temperature) or days (refrigerated). Document date prepared, expiration time.</p></section><section id="quality"><h2>Quality Control</h2><h3>Visual Inspection</h3><p>Before administering any compounded preparation: examine for color changes (indicate degradation), precipitate/cloudiness in solutions (contamination/degradation), crystal formation (salt out of solution), mold/growth on surface (contamination). If any abnormality: discard, do not use.</p><h3>Clarity and Particulates</h3><p>Solutions should be clear. Suspensions cloudy (expected). Look against light for particles (especially for injectable solutions—particles can cause emboli). Filter through clean cloth if particles present and not suspension-type. For injectable: use 0.22 micron sterile filter if available.</p><h3>pH Testing (if available)</h3><p>Some medications require specific pH for stability. pH paper (strips, meters) can assess. Extreme pH (very acidic/alkaline) indicates degradation/contamination. Most injectable solutions neutral (pH 6.5-7.5); if significantly different, suspect degradation.</p><h3>Microbial Sampling</h3><p>In normal practice: cultures on appropriate media confirm sterility. In survival: impossible to perform. Preventive: strict aseptic technique, use sterile components, proper storage. Assume: anything prepared without aseptic technique may be contaminated; use only for serious conditions when benefit outweighs risk.</p></section><section id="storage"><h2>Storage and Stability</h2><h3>Factors Affecting Stability</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Factor<th scope="row">Effect<th scope="row">Mitigation<tr><td>Heat<td>Accelerates chemical breakdown<td>Store cool; double time at each 10°C increase<tr><td>Light<td>Degrades light-sensitive drugs<td>Amber/opaque containers; store away from light<tr><td>Humidity<td>Moisture absorption causes degradation<td>Desiccant packets; airtight containers<tr><td>Oxygen<td>Oxidation of ingredients<td>Minimize headspace; nitrogen blanketing if possible<tr><td>Microbial growth<td>Contamination, potency loss<td>Aseptic preparation; preservatives (if available); refrigeration</table><h3>Compounded Preparation Stability</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Preparation<th scope="row">Storage<th scope="row">Stability<tr><td>Reconstituted powder (antibiotic)<td>Refrigerated 2-8°C<td>7-14 days (check package)<tr><td>Reconstituted powder (room temp)<td>Room temperature 20-25°C<td>1-4 hours (check package)<tr><td>Liquid (homemade, no preservative)<td>Room temperature<td>4-8 hours<tr><td>Liquid (homemade, no preservative)<td>Refrigerated<td>24-48 hours<tr><td>Topical ointment<td>Room temperature, airtight<td>1-2 months (monitor for separation)</table><h3>Refrigeration in Survival</h3><p>Limited access to refrigeration complicates stability. Mitigations: prepare small quantities (for use within 8-12 hours), use non-refrigerated formulations when possible, consider root cellars/underground storage (cooler, more stable temperature than above ground). Evaporative cooling (water-soaked cloth, clay pot) can reduce temperature 5-15°F if no mechanical refrigeration.</p></section><section id="safety"><div class="warning"><h3>Critical Compounding Safety</h3><ul><li>Calculation errors = dose errors causing toxicity/inefficacy. Double-check all calculations; verify against patient weight/age.<li>Contaminated preparation = introduces infection risk. Aseptic technique essential; discard if contamination suspected.<li>Drug stability compromise = reduced effectiveness or toxicity. Don't use expired/discolored preparations; prepare fresh as possible.<li>Allergen/interaction oversight = serious adverse reaction risk. Obtain full medication history, check for interactions before administering.<li>Measurement errors = incorrect dose. Use calibrated equipment (syringes, graduated cylinders); avoid guessing volumes.</ul></div></section><section id="mistakes"><div class="mistakes"><h3>Common Compounding Errors</h3><ul><li><strong>Using wrong liquid:</strong> Some drugs require specific diluents (saline vs water, sterile vs boiled); confirm before mixing.<li><strong>Insufficient mixing:</strong> Suspensions/solutions must be thoroughly mixed; inadequate mixing causes uneven dosing.<li><strong>Confusing concentration:</strong> 5% not same as 5mg/mL; verify units before calculation.<li><strong>Crushed sustained-release:</strong> Destroys mechanism, causes rapid absorption = toxicity risk. Only crush immediate-release tablets.<li><strong>Exceeding stability window:</strong> Using preparation beyond expiration (especially injectable/suspension) risks infection/toxicity.</ul></div></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="medications.html">Essential Medications</a> • <a href="sterilization-methods.html">Sterilization Methods</a> • <a href="infection-control.html">Infection Control</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
