Ensure personal safety first—injured rescuer becomes additional casualty. Establish perimeter. Don appropriate PPE (gloves, eye protection). Call for emergency services if available. Position yourself upwind of hazardous materials.</p><h3>Triage Categories</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Category<th scope="row">Color<th scope="row">Criteria<th scope="row">Treatment Order<tr><td>Immediate<td>Red<td>Life-threatening but survivable (airway obstruction, severe bleeding, shock)<td>First<tr><td>Delayed<td>Yellow<td>Serious but stable (fractures, moderate lacerations, conscious head injury)<td>Second<tr><td>Minor<td>Green<td>Walking wounded (minor lacerations, sprains, minor burns)<td>Third<tr><td>Expectant<td>Black<td>Dead or unsalvageable (no respirations after airway opening, severe head/thoracic trauma)<td>Last</table><h3>Primary Assessment (ABCs)</h3><p><strong>A - Airway:</strong> Clear obstruction, position for drainage. Open mouth, clear debris, tilt head back. <strong>B - Breathing:</strong> Assess respiration rate and quality. Listen for breathing sounds. Prepare rescue breathing if needed. <strong>C - Circulation:</strong> Check carotid pulse for 10 seconds. If absent, begin CPR. Look for massive external bleeding. Control with direct pressure.</p></section><section id="cpr"><h2>CPR and Rescue Breathing</h2><h3>Adult CPR Sequence</h3><p>For unresponsive, non-breathing adult: 1) Call for help. 2) Place supine on firm surface. 3) Open airway (head tilt-chin lift). 4) Give 30 chest compressions at 100-120 bpm (press hard, push fast, allow full recoil). 5) Give 2 rescue breaths (watch chest rise). 6) Continue 30:2 ratio until AED available, patient revives, or clearly deceased.</p><h3>Compression Technique</h3><p>Position: heel of one hand on lower half of breastbone, other hand on top, fingers interlaced. Depress 2-2.4 inches at least 100 bpm but no more than 120 bpm. Allow full chest recoil between compressions. Minimize interruptions. Rotate compressor every 2 minutes if multiple rescuers to prevent fatigue.</p><h3>Rescue Breathing</h3><p>After 30 compressions: pinch nose, create seal with mouth, blow for 1 second until chest visibly rises. Deliver 2 breaths. If breaths don't cause chest rise, reposition airway and try again. Continue CPR immediately after breaths. If unable to provide rescue breaths, hands-only CPR (continuous compressions) nearly as effective, especially in adults.</p><h3>Choking Adult (Conscious)</h3><p>If patient coughing and talking: encourage continued coughing, monitor. If unable to speak, cough, or breathe: perform Heimlich maneuver. Stand behind, wrap arms around abdomen just above umbilicus. Make fist with one hand, grasp with other. Press firmly upward with quick thrusts. Repeat 5 times or until object expelled or patient loses consciousness. If unconscious, position supine and begin CPR.</p><h3>Recovery Position</h3><p>For unconscious, breathing patient: place on side with head tilted back to maintain airway. Left arm under head, right arm across chest. Right knee bent. This position allows drainage, prevents aspiration. Check airway frequently. Monitor breathing and pulse continuously.</p></section><section id="bleeding"><h2>Hemorrhage Control</h2><h3>Wound Classification</h3><ul><li><strong>Abrasion:</strong> Superficial scrape, minimal bleeding, high infection risk<li><strong>Laceration:</strong> Clean cut from sharp object, predictable bleeding, varies by location/depth<li><strong>Puncture:</strong> Deep, narrow wound from pointed object; risk of deep infection, hidden blood loss<li><strong>Avulsion:</strong> Tissue torn away; significant bleeding, tissue viability depends on mechanism<li><strong>Crush Injury:</strong> Traumatic tissue damage from blunt force; severe pain, rhabdomyolysis risk</ul><h3>Direct Pressure Technique</h3><p>Apply firm, continuous pressure with clean cloth directly on wound for minimum 10 minutes. Do NOT repeatedly lift cloth to check. If blood soaks through, add layers on top (don't remove). Elevation helps: position limb above heart level. If extremity, consider distal pulse and limb viability. Pressure should stop bleeding in 10-15 minutes for most wounds.</p><h3>Tourniquet Application</h3><p>For severe limb hemorrhage uncontrolled by pressure (amputation, massive laceration): apply tourniquet 2-3 inches above wound, never over joint. Tighten until bleeding stops completely and distal pulse disappears. Note time applied (critical for tissue viability). Tourniquet can safely remain for 2+ hours in survival setting if necessary. High risk of limb loss if >4-6 hours. Reassess distal circulation when possible.</p><h3>Wound Packing</h3><p>For deep wounds with uncontrolled bleeding: pack wound firmly with hemostatic gauze (Combat Gauze, Celox, or plain if unavailable) saturated with direct pressure. Maintain pressure for full recommended time (up to 3 minutes for hemostatic gauze). Cover with compression dressing. Do not remove packing prematurely; let it stay in place for 24-48 hours.</p><h3>Hemorrhage Staging</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Class<th scope="row">Blood Loss<th scope="row">Symptoms<th scope="row">Intervention<tr><td>I<td><15% BV<td>Minimal, no shock signs<td>Observation, oral fluids if conscious<tr><td>II<td>15-30% BV<td>Anxiety, tachycardia, tachypnea<td>Aggressive fluid replacement, elevate limbs<tr><td>III<td>30-40% BV<td>Confusion, weak pulse, pale, cold<td>IV fluids, tourniquet for limb injury, prepare for evacuation<tr><td>IV<td>>40% BV<td>Unconscious, barely palpable pulse, severe vasoconstriction<td>CPR, aggressive resuscitation, urgent evacuation</table></section><section id="shock"><h2>Shock Management</h2><h3>Shock Recognition</h3><p>Shock is inadequate tissue perfusion. Early signs: anxiety, restlessness, tachycardia (heart rate >100), rapid shallow breathing, pale clammy skin, delayed capillary refill (>2 seconds). Late signs: unconsciousness, barely palpable pulse, severe bradycardia, cold extremities. Act immediately; shock is life-threatening.</p><h3>Types of Shock</h3><ul><li><strong>Hypovolemic:</strong> Blood/fluid loss. Treatment: control bleeding, fluid replacement, elevate legs.<li><strong>Cardiogenic:</strong> Heart pump failure. Treatment: elevate head, minimize activity, medications if available.<li><strong>Septic:</strong> Systemic infection. Treatment: antibiotics, fluid replacement, identify infection source.<li><strong>Anaphylactic:</strong> Severe allergic reaction. Treatment: epinephrine IM, airway support, antihistamines.<li><strong>Neurogenic:</strong> Spinal cord injury. Treatment: immobilize spine, fluid support cautiously.</ul><h3>Shock Management Protocol</h3><ol><li>Maintain airway; position patient on back with legs elevated 8-12 inches (cardiac exception: head elevated if pulmonary edema suspected)<li>Control all bleeding; apply pressure and tourniquet as needed<li>Prevent further heat loss; insulate from ground, cover with blankets<li>Maintain calm reassuring presence; anxiety worsens shock<li>Prepare for evacuation; shock is medical emergency<li>Monitor closely; record vital signs every 15 minutes if possible<li>If accessible: start IV lines, give fluids for hypovolemic shock (if internal bleeding suspected, limit fluids)</ol></section><section id="wounds"><h2>Wound Management</h2><h3>Wound Cleaning</h3><p>For minor wounds: wash with soap and clean water, removing visible dirt and debris. For field expedient: use boiled cooled water (minimum) or saline solution. Avoid harsh antiseptics on large wounds (kills healthy tissue). For contaminated wounds: aggressive cleaning more important than infection prevention medication.</p><h3>Infection Prevention</h3><ul><li>Remove all foreign material (dirt, fiber, etc.)<li>Irrigate copiously with clean water (2+ liters for heavily contaminated)<li>Consider high-pressure irrigation if available and wound not heavily contaminated initially<li>Avoid tourniquet effect from tight bandaging; allow some drainage initially<li>Elevate when possible to reduce swelling and promote drainage<li>Monitor for signs of infection (increasing pain, red streaking, purulent drainage, fever)</ul><h3>Closure Decisions</h3><p>Primary closure (immediate suturing): appropriate for clean wounds <6-8 hours old. Delay closure: contaminated/heavily bleeding wounds or after 8 hours. May close after infection risk passes (24-48 hours). Never close puncture wounds; allow drainage. Wounds on highly vascular areas (face, scalp) tolerate delayed closure better than less vascular areas.</p><h3>Dressing Changes</h3><p>For wounds with continuous drainage: change dressing daily or when soaked through. For healing wounds: change dressing every 2-3 days if keeping closed, or every day if wet. Clean gently, assess for signs of infection, apply fresh antiseptic/antibiotic ointment, cover with clean dressing. Watch for malodor, excessive drainage, discoloration indicating infection.</p></section><section id="fractures"><h2>Fracture and Splinting</h2><h3>Fracture Signs</h3><p>Pain (especially with movement), swelling (usually within minutes), deformity (bone angle abnormal), discoloration (bruising appears), loss of function, crepitus (grinding sensation). Open fractures have break in skin; high infection risk. Compartment syndrome (swelling so severe as to cut off circulation) is surgical emergency.</p><h3>Splinting Principles</h3><ul><li><strong>Immobilize:</strong> Prevent movement of fracture site; reduces pain and prevents neurovascular damage<li><strong>Include joints:</strong> Splint joint above and below fracture site<li><strong>Pad well:</strong> Prevents pressure ulcers; use cloth, foam, or rolled newspaper<li><strong>Check distal circulation:</strong> After splinting, verify pulses, color, temperature, capillary refill distal to splint<li><strong>Monitor for swelling:</strong> Loosen splint if swelling worsens or toes/fingers become cold/blue<li><strong>Elevate when possible:</strong> Reduces swelling, improves comfort</ul><h3>Field Expedient Splinting</h3><p>Without commercial splints: improvise with rolled newspapers, cardboard, boards, or pillows. Secure with cloth strips, torn fabric, or vines. Sling and swathe for upper limb using cloth strips. For leg: double-splint (board on each side) secured with cloth strips every 4-6 inches. For spine: rigid splint or firm surface (backboard). Ensure splint doesn't cut off circulation.</p><h3>Open Fracture Management</h3><p>Priority: control bleeding (arterial bleeding immediate threat), clean wound, stabilize fracture before transport. Cover wound with clean dressing; do not probe. Administer antibiotics if available (reduces infection risk significantly). Tetanus prophylaxis if available. Open fractures almost always require professional care; stabilize and evacuate.</p></section><section id="burns"><h2>Burn Treatment</h2><h3>Burn Classification</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Depth<th scope="row">Appearance<th scope="row">Sensation<th scope="row">Healing<tr><td>Superficial (1st degree)<td>Red, dry<td>Very painful<td>3-7 days, no scarring<tr><td>Partial thickness (2nd degree)<td>Blistered, wet, red<td>Very painful to touch<td>2-3 weeks, may scar<tr><td>Full thickness (3rd degree)<td>Charred, leathery, white<td>Pain at edges only<td>Requires grafting, will scar<tr><td>Deep tissue (4th degree)<td>Charred muscle/bone<td>Minimal<td>Amputation may be needed</table><h3>Burn Percentage (Rule of 9s)</h3><p>Head: 9%, each arm: 9%, chest: 18%, abdomen: 18%, each leg: 18%, genitals: 1%. Burns >20% require fluid resuscitation (severe dehydration risk). Burns >30% mortality significant even with professional care. >50% burns have poor prognosis in field settings.</p><h3>Acute Burn Management</h3><ol><li>Stop burning: extinguish flames, remove from heat source<li>Cool wound: immerse in cool water for 10-20 minutes (reduces depth), avoid ice (risks frostbite)<li>Assess: determine depth percentage, estimate % of body surface area<li>Cover: use clean, dry cloth; prevents contamination and reduces heat loss<li>Pain control: NSAIDs, opioids if available and patient can swallow<li>Fluids: for >20% burns, replace volume (Parkland formula: 4mL × %TBSA × body weight in kg in first 24 hours, half in first 8 hours)<li>Prevent infection: change dressing daily, watch for infection signs</ol><h3>Burn Wound Care</h3><p>Daily cleaning: remove loose tissue gently, apply antibiotic ointment (Silvadene if available), cover with non-adherent dressing. Watch for eschar (dead tissue) that may restrict breathing/circulation on circumferential burns. Monitor for compartment syndrome. Elevate burned limbs. Encourage movement to prevent contractures.</p></section><section id="choking"><h2>Choking and Airway Management</h2><h3>Foreign Body Airway Obstruction (FBAO)</h3><p>Signs: unable to speak, weak cough, no breathing sounds, panic, cyanosis. If partial obstruction (still coughing/talking): encourage continued coughing, monitor, prepare to act. If complete obstruction: immediate intervention needed—perform Heimlich for adults, back blows + chest thrusts for infants.</p><h3>Infant Choking</h3><p>For infant (<1 year) with FBAO: 1) Give 5 back blows: support chin/jaw with hand, deliver sharp blows between shoulder blades. 2) Give 5 chest thrusts: place 2 fingers on breastbone just below nipple line, press downward 1-1.5 inches, 5 times. 3) Sweep mouth (only if can see object). 4) Repeat cycle until object dislodges or infant becomes unconscious.</p><h3>Airway Positioning</h3><p>Head tilt-chin lift: Place hand on forehead, tilt head back gently. Place fingers under chin, lift gently. Opens airway by removing tongue obstruction. For trauma: avoid neck extension; use jaw thrust instead (fingers under angle of jaw, lift forward without neck extension).</p><h3>Oral Airway Insertion</h3><p>For unconscious patient without gag reflex: measure oral airway (corner of mouth to earlobe). Insert upside down, rotate 180 degrees as sliding into mouth, or insert directly right-side up. Airway keeps tongue forward, allows breathing around. Monitor closely; removes airway if patient becomes conscious/gags.</p></section><section id="poisoning"><h2>Poisoning and Overdose</h2><h3>Poison Assessment</h3><p>Determine: substance (if possible), route of exposure (ingestion, inhalation, skin, injection), time of exposure, amount, patient condition. Symptoms vary by toxin: altered mental status, seizures, respiratory depression, arrhythmias, GI upset, skin/eye irritation.</p><h3>General Poisoning Management</h3><ul><li><strong>Activate airway protection:</strong> Position for drainage, be prepared to suction<li><strong>Decontamination:</strong> Remove contaminated clothing, wash skin thoroughly with water (avoid harsh scrubbing)<li><strong>Induced vomiting:</strong> Generally NOT recommended (risks aspiration, further tissue damage); only for specific substances with professional guidance<li><strong>Activated charcoal:</strong> If available and ingestion <1-2 hours: 50-100g mixed with water (only if airway protected). Binds many toxins, prevents absorption<li><strong>Supportive care:</strong> Fluids, monitor airway, manage seizures with benzodiazepines if available<li><strong>Antidotes:</strong> Specific to toxin (naloxone for opioids, methylene blue for methemoglobinemia, etc.)</ul><h3>Common Toxin Overview</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Toxin<th scope="row">Route<th scope="row">Effects<th scope="row">Management<tr><td>Opioids<td>Any<td>Respiratory depression, pinpoint pupils<td>Naloxone IV/IM/IN<tr><td>Stimulants (cocaine, meth)<td>Any<td>Hypertension, agitation, arrhythmias<td>Benzodiazepines, supportive care<tr><td>Anticholinergics<td>Ingestion<td>Tachycardia, dilated pupils, altered mental status<td>Supportive, physostigmine if severe<tr><td>Acetaminophen<td>Ingestion<td>Liver damage (delayed 24-72 hours)<td>N-acetylcysteine if <8 hours<tr><td>Corrosives<td>Ingestion<td>Burning mouth/throat, vomiting blood<td>Do NOT induce vomiting; dilute, supportive care</table></section><section id="safety"><div class="warning"><h3>Critical Safety Protocols</h3><ul><li>Scene safety is paramount: do not become victim yourself.
