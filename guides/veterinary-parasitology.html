Transmission: fecal-oral (grazing contaminated pasture, coprophagy). Symptoms: diarrhea, anemia (especially Haemonchus—blood-feeding), weight loss, poor growth, pale mucous membranes. Diagnosis: fecal float/McMaster count (identifies eggs, estimates burden). Treatment: anthelmintics (deworming agents).</p><h3>Tapeworms (Cestodes)</h3><p>Transmission: intermediate hosts (fleas for pets; arthropods for livestock). Symptoms: variable (often asymptomatic in adults; more severe in young animals). Segments visible in stool (rice-grain appearance). Diagnosis: visual identification of segments, fecal exam. Treatment: praziquantel or similar tapeworm-specific anthelmintics.</p><h3>Flukes (Trematodes)</h3><p>Transmission: through water (metacercariae on plants). Common: liver flukes (Fasciola), lung flukes. Symptoms: anemia, weight loss, poor production, potentially fatal if heavy burden. Diagnosis: fecal exam (eggs), serology. Treatment: specific anthelmintics (triclabendazole for liver flukes). Prevention: eliminate snail hosts (if possible), prevent water contamination.</p></section><section id="external"><h2>External Parasites</h2><h3>Ectoparasites (Lice, Mites, Fleas)</h3><p><strong>Lice:</strong> Blood-feeding or biting. Transmission: direct contact, fomites (shared equipment). Symptoms: itching, hair loss, scabbing, reduced performance. <strong>Mites:</strong> Cause mange/scabies. Highly contagious. Sarcoptes mites (burrow into skin—sarcoptic mange); Psoroptes/Chorioptes (surface—psoroptic/chorioptic mange). Symptoms: severe itching, hair loss, skin thickening/cracking, secondary infection. <strong>Fleas:</strong> Irritation, anemia (heavy infestation), tapeworm transmission (flea ingestion). Diagnosis: visual identification, scraping (mites), fecal exam for tapeworm transmission.</p><h3>Tick Infestation</h3><p>Ticks transmit disease (see zoonotic disease section) but also cause direct damage. Heavy tick burden: anemia, tick paralysis (rare, neurologic). Removal: grasp near mouthparts with tweezers, pull straight out. Do NOT crush (releases pathogens). Disinfect bite site. Tick control: pasture management (remove brush, tick habitat), rotating grazing, seasonal dipping if access to chemical control.</p><h3>Fly Infestation</h3><p><strong>Botflies:</strong> Larval migration under skin, parasitic burden. <strong>Screwworms:</strong> Flesh-eating larvae in open wounds (catastrophic, high mortality if untreated). <strong>Stable flies:</strong> Blood-feeders, painful bites, reduced production. Treatment: fly control (elimination of breeding sites), wound dressing (prevent fly access to screwworm wounds), specific anthelmintics (ivermectin covers some internal parasites + some external parasites).</p></section><section id="protozoa"><h2>Protozoan Parasites</h2><h3>Coccidiosis</h3><p>Transmission: fecal-oral (contaminated water/feed). Common in young animals (ruminants, poultry, rabbits). Symptoms: diarrhea (often bloody), anemia, dehydration, weight loss, potential death if severe/untreated. Diagnosis: fecal exam (oocysts). Treatment: coccidiostats (sulfonamides, amprolium if available) or toltrazuril. Prevention: sanitation, separate young animals (reduce transmission), rotation grazing, stress management (improves immunity).</p><h3>Giardiasis</h3><p>Transmission: cysts in water. Symptoms: diarrhea, weight loss, malabsorption. Common in young ruminants, less severe in adults. Diagnosis: fecal antigen, PCR. Treatment: metronidazole, albendazole. Prevention: clean water, sanitation.</p><h3>Cryptosporidiosis</h3><p>Transmission: oocysts in water/feces. Highly contagious. Symptoms: severe watery diarrhea, weight loss, dehydration. Severe in young/immunocompromised. Diagnosis: fecal exam (small oocysts, difficult to see), special staining. Treatment: supportive care, fluid/electrolyte replacement. Antiparasitic: paromomycin sometimes helps. Prevention: sanitation, isolation of affected animals.</p></section><section id="diagnosis"><h2>Diagnosis Methods</h2><h3>Fecal Examination</h3><p><strong>Direct smear:</strong> Fresh feces on slide with saline, examine for motile parasites, larvae, oocysts. <strong>Flotation:</strong> Feces mixed with flotation solution (sugar, salt, other solutions); parasites float to surface, collected on coverslip. Most practical field method. <strong>Sedimentation:</strong> Heavy parasites sediment; used for some flukes/nematodes. <strong>McMaster count:</strong> Quantifies eggs per gram feces (indicates parasite burden). More labor-intensive, used for monitoring/research.</p><h3>Visual Inspection</h3><p>Gross observation of feces for: tapeworm segments, nematode worms (especially post-treatment). Visual identification of ectoparasites: lice, mites, ticks. Skin scrapings: for mite identification (material under microscope). Flea combing: collect fleas/flea dirt on paper, identify.</p><h3>Clinical Signs and Herd History</h3><p>Symptoms suggestive of parasites: diarrhea, weight loss, anemia (pale mucous membranes, pale conjunctiva), reduced production, poor growth in young animals. History: recent grazing contaminated pasture, introduction of new animals, seasonal occurrence. Parasite prevalence varies seasonally and geographically.</p></section><section id="treatment"><h2>Treatment Protocols</h2><h3>Anthelmintic Selection</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Drug Class<th scope="row">Target Parasites<th scope="row">Dose<th scope="row">Persistence<tr><td>Benzimidazoles (fenbendazole, albendazole)<td>Most nematodes, some tapeworms<td>10-15 mg/kg<td>3-6 weeks (long-acting forms available)<tr><td>Levamisole<td>Many nematodes, some tapeworms<td>5-7 mg/kg<td>Short (single dose)<tr><td>Ivermectin<td>GI nematodes, external parasites, some internal parasites<td>0.2-0.3 mg/kg<td>2-4 weeks<tr><td>Praziquantel<td>Tapeworms, flukes<td>20-30 mg/kg<td>Single dose<tr><td>Morantel<td>GI nematodes<td>10 mg/kg<td>Short-term</table><h3>Dosing Considerations</h3><p>Weight-based dosing critical: under-dosing = ineffective treatment + resistance development. Over-dosing = toxicity. Accurate weighing essential; estimate if scale unavailable (visual estimate less reliable). Fatting animals: calculate dose on current weight (may need repeat as weight increases). Young animals: metabolize drugs faster; may need higher mg/kg or more frequent dosing.</p><h3>Treatment Timing and Monitoring</h3><p>Treat: before grazing season (spring deworming), mid-season if burden high, strategically before winter if resources limited. Repeat: 2-3 weeks after initial treatment (targets emerging larvae). Monitor: fecal exam post-treatment (confirms efficacy), observe clinical improvement (weight gain, coat quality, reduced diarrhea). Failure to respond: suggests resistance (switch drug class) or incorrect diagnosis.</p></section><section id="prevention"><h2>Prevention Strategies</h2><h3>Pasture Management</h3><ul><li>Rotation grazing: move animals before parasite larvae mature (species-dependent, typically 3-4 weeks minimum)<li>Alternate species: different species have different parasites; rotating pasture use reduces buildup<li>Spelling (resting) pastures: allows larvae to die (no host to infect); >2 months typical<li>Clean pastures for young animals: move young animals to uncontaminated pasture (low parasite risk)<li>Avoid wet areas: some parasites favor moisture (flukes need water, many nematodes survive better in wet conditions)</ul><h3>Sanitation</h3><p>Separate water from feces: prevent water contamination (reduces GI parasite transmission). Clean feeders/waterers: remove accumulated feces. Isolate infected/treated animals: prevent cross-contamination. Proper waste disposal: prevent pasture contamination from manure piles.</p><h3>Nutrition and Immunity</h3><p>Good nutrition supports parasite resistance: adequate protein, minerals (copper, selenium, zinc), vitamins. Young animals: need nutrition support for immunity development. Older animals: may tolerate higher parasite loads if well-nourished. Stress management: stress reduces immunity (transport, weather changes, mixed herd groups); minimize stress during high-parasite season.</p><h3>Selective Treatment</h3><p>Not all animals need treatment: some resistance develops naturally. Treat high-risk groups: young animals, pregnant/lactating females, immunocompromised. Monitor non-treated animals: if disease develops, treat then. Reduces anthelmintic use, slows resistance development.</p></section><section id="species-specific"><h2>Species-Specific Considerations</h2><h3>Ruminants (Cattle, Sheep, Goats)</h3><p>GI nematodes primary concern. Haemonchus (blood-feeder): anemia, weakness; requires frequent monitoring. Coccidiosis: primarily young animals (post-weaning age critical). Flukes: wet areas/snail habitats. Lice: common in housed animals (winter housing increases transmission). Ectoparasites: seasonal variation (higher spring/fall).</p><h3>Poultry</h3><p>Internal: large roundworms, tapeworms, cecal worms. Coccidiosis: devastating in young birds (chicks, poults). External: lice, mites (especially Northern fowl mite—anemia/death if heavy). Treatment: often added to water or feed (convenient for flock treatment). Sanitation critical: deep litter becomes contaminated.</p><h3>Dogs and Cats</h3><p>Roundworms: puppies/kittens commonly infected (maternal transmission possible). Hookworms: severe in young animals (anemia). Tapeworms: common, often from fleas. Heartworms: transmitted by mosquitoes (prevent with ivermectin if endemic). Fleas/ticks: constant risk (prevention essential = year-round in many climates). Intestinal protozoa: giardia common in young animals.</p></section><section id="safety"><div class="warning"><h3>Critical Parasitology Safety</h3><ul><li>Untreated parasite burden = poor performance/weight loss/potential death. Treat appropriately; don't assume animals will outgrow parasites.<li>Anthelmintic resistance = emerging problem. Avoid repeated dosing of same drug class; rotate drug classes, use combination therapy if available.<li>Overdosing = toxicity. Accurate weight critical; some drugs have narrow safety margins (morantel, some antiparasitic combinations).<li>Zoonotic parasites = some animal parasites infect humans (toxoplasmosis from cats, some worms from contact). Use hygiene with infected animals.</ul></div></section><section id="mistakes"><div class="mistakes"><h3>Common Parasitology Errors</h3><ul><li><strong>Under-dosing:</strong> Ineffective treatment + resistance development. Weigh accurately, calculate proper dose.<li><strong>Repeated same-class dosing:</strong> Promotes resistance. Rotate drug classes annually.<li><strong>Ignoring young animals:</strong> Assume all young animals need parasite management; fecal exam confirms need.<li><strong>Over-treatment:</strong> Not all animals/situations need treatment; selective treatment reduces drug use, resistance risk.<li><strong>Neglecting sanitation:</strong> Treatment without hygiene = reinfection. Combined approach essential.</ul></div></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="medications.html">Essential Medications</a> • <a href="zoonotic-disease.html">Zoonotic Diseases</a> • <a href="infection-control.html">Infection Control</a> • <a href="veterinary-obstetrics.html">Veterinary Obstetrics</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
