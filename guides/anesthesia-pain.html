Improper anesthesia can cause permanent nerve damage, cardiovascular collapse, respiratory failure, and death. Regional blocks carry risk of intravascular injection, seizures, and cardiovascular toxicity. Never attempt procedures beyond your skill level. Opiate management requires strict adherence to dosing and monitoring protocols to prevent overdose, respiratory depression, and death. All anesthetic agents require careful patient monitoring, airway equipment, and emergency resuscitation capability. When professional anesthesia is available, use it.

Local Anesthesia with Lidocaine </h2><p> Lidocaine is the most common local anesthetic. It blocks pain by preventing nerve signal transmission in localized area. Effects last 30-120 minutes depending on concentration and route. </p><h3> Mechanism and Safety </h3><ul><li><strong>Action:</strong> Blocks sodium channels in nerve fibers, preventing action potential propagation.</li><li><strong>Onset:</strong> 3-5 minutes for infiltration, 10-15 minutes for blocks.</li><li><strong>Duration:</strong> 30-120 minutes (longer with epinephrine added).</li><li><strong>Toxicity:</strong> High doses cause CNS toxicity (seizures, loss of consciousness) and cardiac toxicity (arrhythmias, cardiovascular collapse). Maximum safe dose: 4.5 mg/kg without epinephrine, 7 mg/kg with epinephrine.</li></ul><h3> Wound Infiltration </h3><div class="procedure-box"><h4> Technique </h4><ol><li><strong>Clean wound:</strong> Irrigate with saline or clean water to remove debris and bacteria.</li><li><strong>Prepare lidocaine:</strong> If available: 1% lidocaine solution. Without commercial lidocaine, cannot do this procedure.</li><li><strong>Draw solution:</strong> Using sterile syringe and needle (25-27 gauge for infiltration), draw 5-10 ml depending on wound size.</li><li><strong>Inject:</strong> Inject lidocaine into tissue surrounding wound, not into wound itself (causes distortion). Use multiple injection sites to create "ring" of anesthesia around wound.</li><li><strong>Wait:</strong> Allow 3-5 minutes for anesthetic effect before starting procedure.</li><li><strong>Test:</strong> Use needle to test area—patient should not feel sharp pain (pressure/touch is normal).</li></ol></div><h3> Digital Nerve Block (Finger/Toe Anesthesia) </h3><p> Blocks pain in entire finger/toe with single injection at base. </p><div class="procedure-box"><h4> Technique </h4><ol><li><strong>Identify injection site:</strong> At base of digit (on either side of metacarpal head), between skin and bone.</li><li><strong>Insert needle:</strong> Using 25-gauge needle and 1% lidocaine, enter skin at medial side (inner) of digit base.</li><li><strong>Inject:</strong> Inject 3-5 ml as needle advances toward bone. Withdraw needle slightly, then inject another 2-3 ml at lateral (outer) side.</li><li><strong>Total volume:</strong> 5-10 ml total for single digit.</li><li><strong>Wait:</strong> 5-10 minutes for full anesthetic effect. Test with needle.</li></ol><div class="critical-box"><strong>Never use epinephrine for digital blocks.</strong> Epinephrine causes vasoconstriction and can cause tissue death if injected into finger/toe with limited blood supply. Always use plain lidocaine without epinephrine for digits. </div></div><h3> Dental Block (Inferior Alveolar Nerve Block) </h3><p> Anesthetizes lower teeth and gums on one side. </p><div class="procedure-box"><h4> Anatomy and Technique </h4><ol><li><strong>Locate landmark:</strong> Intraoral approach—place finger on ramus of mandible (bone on side of jaw below ear). Feel bony ridge running vertically.</li><li><strong>Identify injection point:</strong> On inside of cheek opposite lower molars, at midpoint between front of ramus and back of ramus. Slightly above level of occlusal plane (where teeth meet).</li><li><strong>Insert needle:</strong> Using 25-gauge needle, insert at identified point at 45-degree angle, advancing slowly toward bone.</li><li><strong>Contact bone:</strong> Needle should make contact with lateral pterygoid plate or ramus. Withdraw 1 mm.</li><li><strong>Inject:</strong> Aspirate to ensure not in blood vessel, then inject 1.5-2 ml slowly.</li><li><strong>Allow time:</strong> 3-5 minutes for full anesthetic effect. Lower lip will tingle/become numb (sign of proper block).</li></ol></div></section><section class="content-section" id="section2"><h2> 2. Herbal Sedatives and Analgesics </h2><p> Plant-based pain relievers and sedatives lack precision dosing and potency of pharmaceuticals, but can provide meaningful relief in remote settings. </p><h3> Willow Bark (Salix alba/nigra) - Aspirin Equivalent </h3><div class="dosage"><strong>Active compound:</strong> Salicin (converted to salicylic acid in body) <br><br><strong>Preparation:</strong><br> - Strip inner bark from young willow branches<br> - Dry thoroughly (several days in sun/heat)<br> - Powder dried bark <br><br><strong>Dosing:</strong><br> - Tea: 1-2 teaspoons powder per cup boiling water, steep 10 minutes<br> - Drink 3 times daily for pain<br> - Dose: Equivalent to 100-300 mg aspirin<br> - Slower onset (15-30 min) than aspirin<br> - Duration: 4-6 hours <br><br><strong>Effects:</strong> Anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-fever <br><br><strong>Contraindications:</strong> Aspirin allergy, bleeding disorders, use with anticoagulants </div><h3> Valerian Root (Valeriana officinalis) </h3><div class="dosage"><strong>Active compounds:</strong> Valerenic acids, iridoid glycosides <br><br><strong>Preparation:</strong><br> - Dig roots of established plant (1-2 years old)<br> - Clean and dry thoroughly (1-2 weeks)<br> - Grind to powder or cut into small pieces <br><br><strong>Dosing:</strong><br> - Tea: 1 teaspoon dried root per cup water, simmer 10 minutes<br> - Drink 30-60 minutes before sleep or for anxiety<br> - Can take 1-2 cups for sedation<br> - Tincture: If alcohol available, soak roots in 40% alcohol for 2-3 weeks, strain. Dose 1 teaspoon before sleep <br><br><strong>Effects:</strong> Sedation, anxiety reduction, mild analgesia <br><br><strong>Onset:</strong> 30-60 minutes <br><br><strong>Notes:</strong> Taste unpleasant; effects cumulative over several days. Safer than pharmaceutical sedatives but less predictable. </div><h3> Passion Flower (Passiflora edulis/incarnata) </h3><div class="dosage"><strong>Active compounds:</strong> Flavonoids, alkaloids <br><br><strong>Preparation:</strong><br> - Harvest aerial parts (stems, leaves, flowers)<br> - Dry thoroughly<br> - Create tea or tincture <br><br><strong>Dosing:</strong><br> - Tea: 1-2 teaspoons dried herb per cup boiling water, steep 5 minutes<br> - Drink 2-3 times daily for anxiety<br> - Tincture: 20-40 drops in water 2-3 times daily <br><br><strong>Effects:</strong> Anxiety reduction, mild sedation, muscle relaxation <br><br><strong>Onset:</strong> 15-30 minutes <br><br><strong>Notes:</strong> Synergistic with valerian. Safer than benzodiazepines with minimal side effects. </div><h3> Kava Root (Piper methysticum) - CAUTION </h3><div class="dosage"><strong>Active compounds:</strong> Kavalactones <br><br><strong>WARNING:</strong> Can cause liver toxicity with chronic use or high doses. Reserved for acute severe anxiety/insomnia only. <br><br><strong>Preparation:</strong><br> - Grind dried root to powder<br> - Mix with cool or warm water (don't boil—destroys active compounds) <br><br><strong>Dosing (ACUTE USE ONLY):</strong><br> - 4-6 grams dried root in water, consumed as drink<br> - Effects appear in 5-30 minutes<br> - Duration: 2-8 hours<br> - Do not use more than 2-3 consecutive days <br><br><strong>Effects:</strong> Sedation, muscle relaxation, anxiety reduction. More potent than valerian or passion flower. </div><h3> Chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla) </h3><div class="dosage"><strong>Active compounds:</strong> Apigenin, bisabolol, chamazulene <br><br><strong>Preparation:</strong><br> - Harvest flowers at peak bloom<br> - Dry thoroughly<br> - Store in sealed container <br><br><strong>Dosing:</strong><br> - Tea: 1-2 teaspoons dried flowers per cup boiling water, steep 3-5 minutes<br> - Drink 2-3 times daily<br> - Safe for children and pregnancy (generally)<br> - Mild effect—good for anxiety and minor pain combined with other herbs <br><br><strong>Effects:</strong> Mild sedation, anti-inflammatory, spasmolytic (reduces cramping) </div></section><section class="content-section" id="section3"><h2> 3. Ethical Use of Opiates: Framework and Dangers </h2><p> Opiates are extremely dangerous and addictive but may be the only option for severe pain in extremity. This section addresses ethical use, not advocacy for use. </p><h3> When Opiates May Be Necessary </h3><ul><li><strong>Severe trauma pain:</strong> Severe fractures, crush injuries, amputation—pain so severe patient cannot function for necessary procedures.</li><li><strong>Perioperative pain:</strong> Before and after emergency surgery when no anesthesia available.</li><li><strong>End-of-life care:</strong> Terminal illness without hope of intervention; comfort care prioritized.</li><li><strong>Acute myocardial infarction (heart attack):</strong> Morphine reduces cardiac workload and anxiety.</li></ul><h3> Opioid Dangers and Addiction </h3><ul><li><strong>Respiratory depression:</strong> Opioids slow breathing, can stop breathing entirely at high doses. Death results from respiratory failure.</li><li><strong>Physical dependence:</strong> Develops quickly (48-72 hours continuous use). Withdrawal causes severe suffering but not death.</li><li><strong>Psychological addiction:</strong> Powerful euphoria creates craving. Likelihood of addiction increases with each dose.</li><li><strong>Overdose risk:</strong> Narrow margin between therapeutic dose and lethal dose. Tolerance changes constantly.</li><li><strong>Diversion:</strong> In communities without oversight, opiates are stolen, sold, abused. Creates epidemic.</li></ul><h3> Ethical Constraints on Use </h3><ul><li><strong>Last resort:</strong> Only when non-opioid pain management (local anesthesia, herbal sedatives, regional blocks) insufficient.</li><li><strong>Defined endpoint:</strong> Use only until pain reduced to manageable level. Taper as soon as possible to prevent dependence.</li><li><strong>Shortest duration:</strong> Hours to days, not weeks. After 72 hours, withdrawal risk becomes significant concern balancing against pain relief.</li><li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Constant respiratory monitoring. Know how to manage respiratory depression (naloxone reversal, manual ventilation).</li><li><strong>No euphoria-seeking:</strong> Use minimal effective dose. Do not escalate past pain relief into sedation.</li><li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Record all doses, timing, indications. Transparent documentation prevents diversion.</li></ul><h3> Morphine Dosing </h3><div class="dosage"><strong>Morphine is the opiate of choice if available.</strong><br><br><strong>Acute severe pain (immediate relief needed):</strong><br> - IV/IM: 5-10 mg for average adult (50-70 kg)<br> - Repeat every 15 minutes as needed, maximum 30 mg in first hour<br> - IV onset: 1-5 minutes<br> - IM onset: 15-30 minutes <br><br><strong>Oral (less ideal, slower onset):</strong><br> - 10-20 mg every 4-6 hours<br> - Onset: 30-60 minutes<br> - Duration: 4-6 hours <br><br><strong>CRITICAL SAFETY:</strong><br> - Do not use in patients with respiratory depression (respiratory rate <12)<br> - Have naloxone (opiate reversal agent) available<br> - Monitor respiratory rate constantly. If RR drops below 10, consider naloxone 0.4-2 mg IV/IM<br> - Do not redose until respiratory effect has worn off<br> - Risk of overdose highest in opiate-naive patients </div><h3> Codeine and Other Opiates </h3><ul><li><strong>Codeine:</strong> Weaker than morphine, oral 15-60 mg every 4-6 hours. Still carries overdose risk but lower potency.</li><li><strong>Fentanyl patches:</strong> Extremely dangerous without hospital monitoring. Do not use in field without expertise.</li><li><strong>Heroin:</strong> Do not use under any circumstances. Same risks as morphine with added infection risks from IV use.</li></ul></section><section class="content-section" id="section4"><h2> 4. Non-Pharmacological Pain Control </h2><p> Many techniques effectively reduce pain without drugs. Often most accessible in resource-limited settings. </p><h3> Distraction and Psychological Techniques </h3><ul><li><strong>Attention direction:</strong> Direct patient's focus away from injured area—conversation, counting, music, viewing something engaging.</li><li><strong>Anticipatory guidance:</strong> Tell patient exactly what to expect before procedures—reduces anxiety and pain perception.</li><li><strong>Pain catastrophizing reduction:</strong> Help patient avoid worst-case thinking. Reassure that pain is temporary and manageable.</li><li><strong>Breathing techniques:</strong> Slow deep breathing (4-count inhale, 6-count exhale) reduces sympathetic activation and pain.</li><li><strong>Positive imagery:</strong> Have patient imagine peaceful place or positive outcome—reduces pain perception measurably.</li></ul><h3> Thermal Therapy </h3><h4> Cold Application </h4><ul><li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Cold numbs tissue, reduces inflammation, slows nerve conduction.</li><li><strong>Application:</strong> Ice, cold water, cold packs for 15 minutes, every 2-3 hours.</li><li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Most effective in first 48 hours after injury. Reduces swelling significantly.</li><li><strong>Precautions:</strong> Do not apply directly to skin (causes ice burn). Use cloth barrier. Avoid in patients with cold sensitivity or poor circulation.</li></ul><h4> Heat Application </h4><ul><li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Heat relaxes muscles, increases circulation, reduces stiffness.</li><li><strong>Application:</strong> Hot water bottle, hot cloth for 15-20 minutes, 2-3 times daily.</li><li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> Better for chronic pain and muscle tension. Not recommended acutely (worsens inflammation) unless muscle spasm is primary problem.</li><li><strong>Precautions:</strong> Monitor for burns. Especially careful in sensory-impaired patients.</li></ul><h3> Elevation and Immobilization </h3><ul><li><strong>Elevation:</strong> Raising injured limb above heart reduces swelling, which reduces pain. Most effective when combined with ice and rest.</li><li><strong>Immobilization:</strong> Prevents movement that exacerbates pain. Splinting/wrapping reduces pain immediately.</li><li><strong>Positioning:</strong> Find and maintain position of comfort. Use pillows for support.</li></ul><h3> Massage and Physical Manipulation </h3><ul><li><strong>Soft tissue massage:</strong> Gentle massage of muscles (not directly over fracture/injury) reduces tension and promotes relaxation.</li><li><strong>Gate control theory:</strong> Gently rubbing area of pain partially closes "pain gate"—touch stimulation blocks pain signal transmission.</li><li><strong>Technique:</strong> Light circular motion with palms or fingers, 5-10 minutes at a time.</li></ul><h3> Acupressure and Trigger Points </h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Location</th><th scope="row">Technique</th><th scope="row">Indications</th></tr><tr><td><strong>LI-4 (Large Intestine 4)</strong><br> Between thumb and index finger, in web space</td><td>Firm pressure, circular motion 1-2 minutes</td><td>Headache, facial pain, overall pain relief</td></tr><tr><td><strong>PC-8 (Pericardium 8)</strong><br> Center of palm</td><td>Firm pressure 1-2 minutes</td><td>Anxiety, pain in palm/arm</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GB-34 (Gallbladder 34)</strong><br> Outer leg, below knee, in small depression</td><td>Firm sustained pressure 1-2 minutes</td><td>Leg pain, muscle cramping</td></tr></table><h3> TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) </h3><p> If battery-powered TENS unit available (unlikely in true remote setting): </p><ul><li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Electrical stimulation blocks pain signal transmission (gate control).</li><li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> 50-70% effective for various pain types.</li><li><strong>Application:</strong> Place pads on skin on either side of pain. Use low frequency (10-50 Hz) for acute pain, high frequency (50-150 Hz) for chronic pain.</li><li><strong>Duration:</strong> 20-30 minutes, 2-3 times daily.</li></ul></section><section class="content-section" id="section5"><h2> 5. Regional Nerve Blocks </h2><p> Advanced technique providing anesthesia to entire region via single injection. High efficacy but requires anatomical knowledge and carries risks. </p><h3> Femoral Nerve Block (Lower Extremity Surgery) </h3><div class="procedure-box"><h4> Anatomy </h4><p> Femoral nerve lies medial to femoral artery in inguinal crease. Anesthetizes entire anterior and medial thigh, knee, and part of lower leg. </p><h4> Technique </h4><ol><li><strong>Patient position:</strong> Supine with hip externally rotated, knee extended.</li><li><strong>Landmarks:</strong> Palpate femoral artery pulse in inguinal crease. Needle insertion point is just medial (inner) to artery, 1 cm below inguinal ligament.</li><li><strong>Needle insertion:</strong> Using 22-25 gauge needle, insert at 45-degree angle aiming cephalad (toward head).</li><li><strong>Advancement:</strong> Advance slowly, aspirating frequently to ensure not in blood vessel.</li><li><strong>Nerve location:</strong> Patient may experience electrical sensation shooting down leg ("paresthesia")—sign of proximity to nerve.</li><li><strong>Injection:</strong> If paresthesia obtained, withdraw slightly. If no paresthesia, stop at 2-3 cm depth. Aspirate to ensure not intravascular, then inject 15-20 ml of 1% lidocaine slowly.</li><li><strong>Onset:</strong> 10-20 minutes for full effect.</li></ol></div><h3> Intercostal Nerve Block (Chest/Rib Pain) </h3><div class="procedure-box"><h4> Anatomy and Indication </h4><p> Nerve runs along inferior border of each rib. Used for rib fractures, chest wall pain, surgical access to chest. </p><h4> Technique </h4><ol><li><strong>Patient position:</strong> Prone or sitting, leaning forward.</li><li><strong>Identify ribs:</strong> Count ribs from top. Palpate the inferior margin (lower edge) of the rib requiring anesthesia.</li><li><strong>Needle angle:</strong> Insert needle at angle perpendicular to chest wall, directly on inferior rib margin.</li><li><strong>Advancement:</strong> Advance until bone contact, then withdraw 2-3 mm (to sit in groove with nerve).</li><li><strong>Injection:</strong> Aspirate to ensure not in lung, then inject 3-5 ml of 1% lidocaine.</li><li><strong>Multiple blocks:</strong> For multiple rib anesthesia, repeat at each rib (can block 2-3 adjacent ribs).</li><li><strong>Onset:</strong> 5-10 minutes.</li></ol><div class="critical-box"><strong>Risk:</strong> Pneumothorax (collapse of lung) from needle penetrating pleura. If patient develops sudden shortness of breath or chest pain, suspect pneumothorax. Evacuate emergently. </div></div><h3> Bier Block (Intravenous Regional Anesthesia) </h3><p> Advanced technique using IV injection of lidocaine into isolated limb under tourniquets. High efficacy, complex setup. </p><div class="procedure-box"><h4> Technique (If Equipment Available) </h4><ol><li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Establish IV access above injury site (arm). Prepare pneumatic tourniquet for proximal application, second tourniquet for distal application.</li><li><strong>Exsanguination:</strong> Elevate limb for 30-60 seconds to drain blood from extremity. Wrap elastic bandage from distal (far) to proximal (near) to further exsanguinate.</li><li><strong>Proximal tourniquet:</strong> Apply and inflate to 50-75 mmHg above systolic blood pressure. Limb should be pale.</li><li><strong>Inject lidocaine:</strong> Via IV, inject 3 mg/kg of 0.5% lidocaine (total 1-2 mg/kg diluted in normal saline to total 50 ml). Inject slowly over 3-5 minutes.</li><li><strong>Onset:</strong> 3-5 minutes. Entire limb becomes numb.</li><li><strong>Duration:</strong> Tourniquet must stay inflated for minimum 20 minutes to allow local anesthetic to bind to tissue. If duration <20 minutes, significant systemic lidocaine absorption occurs when tourniquet released (risk of toxicity).</li><li><strong>Tourniquet management:</strong> If procedure takes >45 minutes, can apply distal tourniquet once limb anesthetized, then release proximal tourniquet (reduces patient discomfort from tourniquet).</li><li><strong>Release:</strong> After procedure, slowly deflate proximal tourniquet every 10 seconds, watching patient for signs of local anesthetic toxicity (restlessness, tremor, seizure, cardiovascular collapse).</li></ol></div></section><section class="content-section" id="section6"><h2> 6. Procedural Sedation </h2><p> Sedation appropriate when procedure requires complete relaxation, immobility, or when patient in severe distress. Requires careful monitoring. </p><h3> Ketamine (If Available) </h3><div class="dosage"><strong>Mechanism:</strong> NMDA receptor antagonist. Induces dissociation (patient sedated but eyes open, protective reflexes intact). <br><br><strong>Advantage:</strong> Maintains airway reflexes and respiratory drive—safer than other anesthetics. <br><br><strong>Dosing:</strong><br> - IV: 1-2 mg/kg bolus over 60 seconds<br> - IM: 4-5 mg/kg<br> - Onset: 30-60 seconds IV, 3-5 minutes IM<br> - Duration: 10-20 minutes <br><br><strong>Monitoring:</strong><br> - Watch respiratory rate (should remain >10)<br> - Patient may be awake but unresponsive—this is expected<br> - Eyes remain open—tape eyelids if concerned about corneal abrasion<br> - Emergence delirium common—reassure patient beforehand <br><br><strong>Precautions:</strong><br> - Do not use if airway compromised<br> - Avoid in patients with hypertension (ketamine raises BP)<br> - Emergence hallucinations/delirium common, usually brief </div><h3> Propofol (If Available) - HIGH RISK </h3><div class="critical-box"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Propofol causes respiratory depression and apnea. Requires advanced airway management capability. Should not be used outside hospital setting without ventilation equipment. Rapid IV boluses can cause cardiovascular collapse. Do not use unless trained and equipped for intubation and ventilation. </div><h3> Monitoring During Sedation </h3><ul><li><strong>Respiratory rate:</strong> Monitor constantly. Normal 12-20 breaths/min. <10 is dangerous.</li><li><strong>Oxygen saturation:</strong> If pulse oximeter available, target >94%.</li><li><strong>Airway patency:</strong> Listen for snoring or obstruction. Be ready to open airway (head tilt-chin lift).</li><li><strong>Responsiveness:</strong> Check patient regularly—call name, pinch shoulder.</li><li><strong>Blood pressure/heart rate:</strong> If monitor available, watch for hypotension (SBP <90) or bradycardia (HR <50).</li></ul><h3> Recovery Position </h3><ul><li>After sedation, place patient in left lateral decubitus position (on left side).</li><li>Head tilted back slightly, one arm under head for support.</li><li>Keeps airway open, allows vomit to drain from mouth if aspiration occurs.</li><li>Monitor constantly until fully awake.</li></ul></section><section class="content-section" id="section7"><h2> 7.

Assess objectively with physical exam and vital signs.</li><li><strong>Using epinephrine for digital blocks:</strong> Vasoconstriction cuts off blood supply to finger/toe—tissue death results. Always use plain lidocaine for digits.</li><li><strong>Injecting into blood vessel:</strong> Always aspirate before injecting any local anesthetic. Intravascular injection causes seizures and cardiovascular collapse.</li><li><strong>Exceeding maximum lidocaine dose:</strong> Toxicity develops rapidly. Maximum 4.5 mg/kg without epinephrine, 7 mg/kg with epinephrine. Calculate carefully.</li><li><strong>Sedating without airway equipment:</strong> Sedation depresses respiration. Must have suction, oxygen, and ability to manually ventilate before using any sedative.</li><li><strong>Releasing Bier block tourniquet before 20 minutes:</strong><20 minutes circulation time causes lidocaine toxicity. Wait minimum 20 minutes even if procedure complete.</li><li><strong>Using inappropriate opioid doses:</strong> Respiratory depression and death result from excessive dosing. Use lowest effective dose, monitor respiratory rate constantly.</li><li><strong>Neglecting pain assessment over time:</strong> Pain changes throughout treatment. Reassess frequently. Escalate or de-escalate analgesia as needed.</li><li><strong>Leaving sedated patient unmonitored:</strong> Airway obstruction, vomiting, respiratory depression can occur suddenly. Constant observation mandatory.</li><li><strong>Attempting regional blocks without anatomical training:</strong> Misplaced nerve blocks fail and may injure surrounding structures (vessels, nerves). Train extensively before clinical use.</li></ul></div></section><div class="notes-section"><div class="notes-header"><span>Pain Management Notes & Patient Records</span><span class="notes-toggle">▼</span></div><div class="notes-content"><textarea class="notes-textarea" placeholder='Document pain levels, medications given, dosages, patient response, adverse effects, and anesthetic techniques used...'></textarea><div class="notes-actions"><button class="save-notes-btn">Save Notes</button><div class="notes-status"></div></div></div></div><div class="footer-nav"><div class="related-guides"><h3> Related Guides </h3><a href="surgery-field.html" class="guide-link">Field Surgery & Wound Care</a><a href="orthopedics-fractures.html" class="guide-link">Orthopedics & Fracture Management</a><a href="../index.html" class="guide-link">← Back to Index</a></div></div><button id="back-to-top" title='Return to top of page'> ↑ </button><script>
