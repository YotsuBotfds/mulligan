Different plants and animals provide fibers with varying properties: strength, flexibility, weather resistance, and durability.</p><h3>Plant Fibers:</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Fiber Source</th><th scope="row">Characteristics</th><th scope="row">Strength</th><th scope="row">Best Uses</th></tr><tr><td>Nettle</td><td>Fine, strong, durable</td><td>Very High</td><td>Nets, rope, cloth</td></tr><tr><td>Flax</td><td>Long staple, smooth, lustrous</td><td>Very High</td><td>Rope, cloth, fishing line</td></tr><tr><td>Hemp</td><td>Coarse, weather-resistant, strong</td><td>High</td><td>Marine rope, binding</td></tr><tr><td>Jute</td><td>Coarse, bulky, biodegradable</td><td>Medium</td><td>Binding, mats, twine</td></tr><tr><td>Palm fibers</td><td>Stiff, fibrous, weather-resistant</td><td>Medium</td><td>Rope, matting, baskets</td></tr><tr><td>Bark (inner)</td><td>Fibrous, flexible when processed</td><td>Low-Medium</td><td>Binding, rough cord</td></tr></table><h3>Animal Fibers:</h3><ul><li><strong>Hair (horse, cow, deer):</strong> Coarse but strong; excellent for rough cordage and brushes</li><li><strong>Intestine:</strong> Natural tubes useful for containers; can be twisted into cordage</li><li><strong>Sinew (tendon):</strong> Extremely strong; primary cordage for bows and fishing line</li></ul></section><section id="fiber-extraction"><h2>Fiber Extraction Techniques</h2><h3>Water Retting (Softening Plant Fibers):</h3><ol><li>Harvest plant stems in morning (before heat reduces sap)</li><li>Bundle stems and submerge in pond/stream water</li><li>Soak 1-2 weeks (until fibers separate easily from woody core)</li><li>Remove from water; spread on ground for drying (2-3 days)</li><li>Break dried stems to expose fibers</li><li>Beat softly with wooden mallet to separate fibers</li><li>Comb with crude comb (remove short fibers, wood fragments)</li></ol><h3>Dry Retting (Alternative):</h3><p>Bundle plants; expose to sun/rain for 2-3 weeks. Weather breaks down pectin naturally. Slower than water retting but requires less water.</p><h3>Bark Processing:</h3><ol><li>Harvest bark from softwood tree (birch, willow, cedar) in spring (sap facilitates peeling)</li><li>Score bark vertically; peel away from trunk</li><li>Separate inner bark from outer bark (inner bark contains fibers)</li><li>Soak inner bark 1-2 days; beat to separate fibers</li><li>Dry and prepare for spinning</li></ol><h3>Sinew Extraction:</h3><ol><li>Remove large tendons from animal legs/spine immediately after slaughter</li><li>Dry sinew fully (2-4 weeks) before processing</li><li>Beat dried sinew to separate into fibers</li><li>Soak briefly to restore flexibility</li><li>Twist fibers together to create cordage</li></ol></section><section id="fiber-prep"><h2>Fiber Preparation & Drying</h2><h3>Cleaning:</h3><p>Remove plant matter, dirt, and debris from extracted fibers. Soak in water, then beat gently with wooden mallet. Repeat until water runs clear. Dry thoroughly before spinning (moisture prevents twisting).</p><h3>Sorting by Length:</h3><p>Long fibers (combed out) are "line fibers"—suitable for strong cordage. Short fibers remaining are "tow"—used for coarser cordage or padding. Separate by carding (combing action) with two wire brushes.</p><h3>Storage:</h3><p>Keep dried fibers in cool, dry location protected from insects. Bundle fibers in handfuls; wrap loosely to prevent mold. Use within 1-2 years of drying (fibers deteriorate gradually).</p></section><section id="spinning"><h2>Spinning Techniques</h2><h3>Simple Hand Spinning (No Equipment):</h3><ol><li>Roll prepared fibers between palms, twisting as you roll</li><li>As yarn builds, extend hands apart to create length</li><li>Fibers naturally align and bind together during twisting</li><li>Build yarn gradually (0.5-1 meter per minute pace)</li><li>Weak spots appear as necks in the yarn; add extra twist when necks appear</li></ol><h3>Drop Spindle Spinning:</h3><p>Spindle (wooden shaft with whorl for momentum) hangs by thread while twisting fibers. Preparation: loop fibers into hanging thread. Work: hold fibers at top of spindle; allow spindle weight to twist fibers while gradually extending arm to create yarn. Efficiency: 2-4 meters per minute. Superior to hand spinning for consistent results.</p><h3>Spinning Wheel:</h3><p>Mechanical device creating continuous twist. Treadle-powered wheel ideal for survival situations (no electricity). Consistency: much faster and more uniform than spindle (10-20 meters per minute possible). Requires wheel construction or salvage, but investment pays dividends in production speed.</p><h3>Yarn Properties:</h3><ul><li><strong>Ply:</strong> Twist angle affects strength. Tight twist = stronger but stiffer; loose twist = more elastic but weaker</li><li><strong>Weight:</strong> Thinner yarn requires more twist; thicker yarn requires less twist</li><li><strong>Smoothness:</strong> Consistent twist produces uniform appearance; variable twist looks coarse</li></ul></section><section id="twisting"><h2>Twisting & Cabling</h2><h3>Two-Ply Twist:</h3><ol><li>Spin two separate yarns</li><li>Hold ends together</li><li>Twist both yarns together in opposite direction to their individual twist</li><li>Result: balanced yarn with doubled strength</li></ol><h3>Three-Ply or Higher:</h3><p>Twist multiple yarns together for even greater strength. Four-ply typical for rope-weight cordage. Twist direction: alternate direction from previous ply for mechanical binding.</p><h3>Cabling (Creating Large Rope):</h3><ol><li>Prepare multiple 3-4 ply cords</li><li>Bundle 2-4 cords together</li><li>Twist bundle in opposite direction to cord twist</li><li>Creates rope with excellent strength and flexibility</li><li>Typical rope: 3 cords x 4-ply each = very strong cordage</li></ol></section><section id="rope-making"><h2>Rope Making Methods</h2><h3>Three-Strand Rope (Most Common):</h3><ol><li>Prepare 3 equal-length cords (minimum 1.5m for functional rope 50cm long)</li><li>Bundle cords together at one end; tie temporary knot</li><li>Separate into 3 strands; hold with one hand</li><li>Twist strands in opposite direction while walking backward with other hand</li><li>Each step increases rope length and tightness</li><li>Complete approximately 100 twists per meter of rope</li><li>Secure end with binding (prevents unraveling)</li></ol><h3>Four-Strand Rope:</h3><p>Superior strength with same diameter compared to three-strand. Construction identical except 4 strands instead of 3. Slightly slower to braid but more durable result.</p><h3>Testing Rope Quality:</h3><p>Bend rope into circle—should return to straight form. Rope that remains bent lacks adequate twist. Pull rope with force—should not slip or unravel. Properly made rope withstands 80-90% of component fiber strength.</p><div class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Create trial ropes from readily available materials (cattail fluff, dried grass) before using valuable fibers. Technique improves significantly over 10-20 practice ropes.</div></section><section id="net-making"><h2>Net Construction</h2><h3>Simple Hand-Tied Net (Fishing or Trapping):</h3><ol><li>Prepare cordage: 6-8 meters length, 3-5mm diameter</li><li>Create frame: bend cordage into rectangle or triangle</li><li>Tie cross-strings at 10-15cm intervals creating grid</li><li>Tie diagonal strings creating diamond-shaped mesh (typical fish net opening: 2-3cm)</li><li>Secure all intersections with square knots</li><li>Complete net: 1-2 square meters size, 2-3 hours labor</li></ol><h3>Knot Mesh Method:</h3><p>Alternative: create mesh by tying individual knots rather than weaving. Knots ensure mesh openings remain uniform. Typical knot: square knot between adjacent lines. More secure but slower than woven mesh.</p><h3>Weighted Edges (Fish Nets):</h3><p>Attach weights (stones wrapped in cordage, or bone/clay weights) to bottom edge. Weights keep net bottom submerged while floats (wood or cork) keep top above water. Fish entering net push it down, creating collapse that traps fish.</p></section><section id="fishing-line"><h2>Fishing Line & Specialized Cordage</h2><h3>Fine Fishing Line from Sinew:</h3><ol><li>Prepare sinew fibers (very thin, 1-2mm)</li><li>Twist 3-4 fibers together lightly</li><li>Result: extremely strong line (sufficient to land fish 2-5kg)</li><li>Knot strength: use clinch knot or improved clinch knot</li><li>Diameter: 1-2mm; invisible underwater</li></ol><h3>Hair/Intestine Fishing Line:</h3><p>Horse hair bundled and twisted creates surprisingly strong fishing line (2-3kg test strength). Intestine (gut) from fish or animal dried and twisted creates very fine, strong line. Both materials less visible underwater than plant fiber cordage.</p><h3>Specialized Knots for Fishing:</h3><ul><li><strong>Palomar knot:</strong> Strong, simple, reliable for attaching lure/hook</li><li><strong>Clinch knot:</strong> Excellent strength; requires 5-7 wraps</li><li><strong>Surgeon's knot:</strong> Joins two lines with strength</li></ul></section><section id="common-mistakes"><h2>Common Mistakes & Solutions</h2><h3>Mistake 1: Inadequate Fiber Preparation</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Spinning fibers that still contain woody material or dirt. Results: weak cordage that breaks during use, poor twist consistency.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Thoroughly clean and comb fibers before spinning. Remove short fibers and fragments. Allow proper drying (moisture content 10-15% optimal).</p><h3>Mistake 2: Inconsistent Twist</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Varying twist rate while spinning. Some sections over-twisted, others under-twisted. Results: weak cordage that breaks at under-twisted sections.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Establish consistent pace and hand positions. Practice spinning on simple materials first. Rhythm is more important than speed.</p><h3>Mistake 3: Insufficient Final Twist in Rope</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Twisting strands together only 50-70 times per meter. Rope lacks sufficient tightness to bind fibers. Results: fibers slip under load.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Twist at least 80-100 times per meter of rope. Rope should appear very tight and dense. Test-load rope to verify strength before trusting with critical tasks.</p><h3>Mistake 4: Poor Knot Selection in Net</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Using simple overhand knots in fishing nets. Knots slip under load as fish struggles. Results: net unravels during use.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use square knots, improved clinch knots, or other reliable knots. Test knot strength by pulling hard before completing entire net.</p></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="cra-06-knot-tying-rigging.html">Knot Tying & Rigging</a><a href="cra-07-primitive-weapons.html">Primitive Weapons (for Fishing)</a><a href="cra-05-weaving-textiles.html">Weaving & Textiles</a><a href="bone-tools.html">Bone Tools</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
