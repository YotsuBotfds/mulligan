Clay must be uniform consistency, free of air bubbles, and properly aged for best working properties.</p><h3>Clay Source & Testing:</h3><p>Collect clay from 1-2 meters below surface (topsoil contains organic matter). Test by making sample pot: if clay shrinks more than 10% or cracks extensively, it needs sand amendment. Ideal clay has 25-35% sand naturally (reduces shrinkage).</p><h3>Wedging Technique (De-Airing):</h3><p>Cut clay block into sections. Stack sections and slam together repeatedly (30+ repetitions). This removes air bubbles and aligns clay particles for uniform behavior during forming. Time investment: 5-10 minutes per 2kg clay. Proper wedging reduces cracking during drying by 50-70%.</p><h3>Aging Clay:</h3><p>Store prepared clay in sealed container (prevents drying) for 1-2 weeks before use. Aging allows bacterial action and particle settling, improving workability. Results in clay that is easier to center on wheel and produces stronger walls.</p></section><section id="hand-building"><h2>Hand Building Techniques</h2><h3>Pinch Bowls:</h3><p>Roll clay into ball (8cm diameter). Push thumb into center, rotate ball while pinching walls outward. Creates simple bowl in 2-3 minutes. Thickness: 5-8mm (thinner walls crack during drying). Suitable for learning basic clay behavior.</p><h3>Coil Method:</h3><p>Roll clay into ropes (1-2cm diameter). Stack coils in spiral pattern, smoothing joints between coils. Can build walls to any height (limited by drying time and weight support). Typical production: 1-2 coil pots per hour. Large storage vessels (20-30 liters) commonly made this way.</p><h3>Slab Construction:</h3><p>Roll clay flat (3-10mm thick) using rolling pin or hands. Cut shapes with knife; join edges using slip (liquid clay). Creates boxes, tiles, and geometric forms. Dried slabs can be stacked for storage vessels.</p><h3>Luting (Joining Surfaces):</h3><p>Roughen both surfaces to be joined. Apply slip (clay mixed with water to paint consistency). Press pieces together firmly; smooth joint. Join strength: properly executed joints are as strong as monolithic clay.</p></section><section id="wheel-throwing"><h2>Wheel Throwing Basics</h2><p>Wheel throwing creates symmetrical forms (bowls, cylinders, vases). Requires practice: expect 80% failure rate initially, improving to 20-30% by 50th attempt.</p><h3>Wheel Setup:</h3><p>Potter's wheel (powered by foot treadle, hand crank, or electric motor). Simple hand-cranked wheel suffices for learning. Clay center-mounted on wheel head. Surrounding bucket catches water used for lubrication.</p><h3>Centering (Most Critical Step):</h3><ol><li>Place clay (500-1000g) on wheel center while spinning at medium speed</li><li>Apply steady downward and inward pressure with hands</li><li>Clay must spin without wobbling (centered condition)</li><li>Time: 30-60 seconds of consistent pressure</li><li>Centering failure results in loss of pot—clay becomes impossible to throw symmetrically</li></ol><h3>Opening (Creating Interior):</h3><ol><li>Slow wheel slightly</li><li>Insert thumbs into clay center while supporting exterior with fingers</li><li>Widen opening by pulling thumbs outward while supporting walls</li><li>Opening should be slightly smaller than desired final diameter</li><li>Leave 10mm clay at bottom (prevents punching through)</li></ol><h3>Pulling Walls:</h3><ol><li>Support clay from exterior and interior simultaneously</li><li>Pull upward slowly, allowing walls to thin</li><li>Each pull should raise walls 2-3cm maximum</li><li>Repeat 5-8 pulls to reach desired height</li><li>Wall thickness should be uniform (8-10mm typical)</li></ol><h3>Finishing:</h3><p>Smooth rim while spinning. Create foot (base) by cutting groove into bottom (allows drying heat penetration). Remove pot from wheel using wire cut underneath. Let dry 24 hours before further work.</p><div class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Save failed pots (recycle by crushing and slurrying back to clay). Failure is part of learning. Keep first 50 pots even if misshapen—observe improvements over time.</div></section><section id="decorative"><h2>Decorative Techniques</h2><h3>Scoring & Detailing:</h3><p>Carve patterns into leather-hard clay (dried 24 hours to stiff state). Tools: bone tools, carved wood implements, or sharp stones. Creates visual interest without adding material.</p><h3>Incising (Carving):</h3><p>Cut lines into clay surface. Can create geometric patterns, letters, or artistic designs. Depth: 2-5mm typical. Deep carving may expose air pockets (cause cracks during drying).</p><h3>Relief Work:</h3><p>Apply additional clay shapes to surface (face patterns, botanical forms). Attach using slip and pressure. Adds dimensional character.</p><h3>Texture:</h3><p>Press materials into soft clay: fabric, leaves, wood grain, carved stamps. Creates textured surface suitable for non-food applications (water catchment vessels, decorative pieces).</p></section><section id="glazing"><h2>Glazing & Surface Treatment</h2><p>Glazes are glass-like coatings fused to clay during firing. Serve functional (waterproofing) and aesthetic (color, finish) purposes.</p><h3>Glaze Composition:</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Component</th><th scope="row">Purpose</th><th scope="row">Examples</th></tr><tr><td>Flux</td><td>Lowers melting temperature</td><td>Lead, alkali, ash</td></tr><tr><td>Glass-former</td><td>Creates glass network</td><td>Silica, feldspar</td></tr><tr><td>Opacifier</td><td>Creates non-transparent glaze</td><td>Tin oxide, zircon</td></tr><tr><td>Colorant</td><td>Adds color</td><td>Iron oxide, cobalt, copper</td></tr></table><h3>Simple Ash Glaze (Survival Appropriate):</h3><p>Mix 40% wood ash + 40% feldspar + 20% silica. Add water to slurry consistency. Apply 2-3mm coating. Fires at 1200°C+. Results in matte brown/tan glaze. Waterproofing: adequate but not perfect (some seepage acceptable for non-food vessels).</p><h3>Iron Oxide Glaze:</h3><p>Add 10% iron oxide to basic ash glaze. Creates dark brown/black color. Improves waterproofing slightly. Temperature: 1200°C+.</p><h3>Application Methods:</h3><ul><li><strong>Brushing:</strong> Apply glaze with broad brush. Fast but leaves brush marks.</li><li><strong>Dipping:</strong> Immerse pot in glaze bucket. Even coverage; requires larger glaze quantities.</li><li><strong>Spraying:</strong> Spray glaze using pump/compressor. Finest finish but requires equipment and safety measures.</li></ul></section><section id="kiln-firing"><h2>Kiln Firing Processes</h2><h3>Bisque Firing (First Firing):</h3><p>Greenware (unfired clay) must be fired slowly to prevent cracking. First firing: heat to 1000-1150°C. Removes water and burns organic matter. Slow heating schedule critical: first 2 hours at 100°C per hour maximum, then 200°C per hour acceptable. Time: 10-15 hours total heating time. Cooling: 24+ hours (rapid cooling causes cracking).</p><h3>Glaze Firing (Second Firing):</h3><p>Bisque ware (after first firing) is less fragile. Glaze firing heats to glaze maturation temperature (typically 1200-1300°C). Schedule: faster heating acceptable (300-400°C per hour). Time: 4-8 hours total. Final cooling: 12-24 hours minimum.</p><h3>Kiln Loading (Stacking):</h3><p>Pots must not touch during firing (they fuse together). Stack with minimum 2cm spacing. Vertical stacking: smaller pots on top (weight distribution). Shelves support upper layers. Air circulation critical: leave gaps for heat flow.</p><h3>Firing Problems & Solutions:</h3><ul><li><strong>Cracking:</strong> Caused by rapid heating or insufficient drying. Solution: slower heat ramp, longer drying time.</li><li><strong>Bloating:</strong> Gas pockets expand, creating bubbles. Solution: lower firing temperature, longer initial heating.</li><li><strong>Glaze running:</strong> Glaze melts too much, runs off pot. Solution: thinner glaze application, lower firing temperature.</li></ul></section><section id="functional-ware"><h2>Functional Ware Production</h2><h3>Water Storage Vessels:</h3><p>Large coil-built pots (20-40 liters) for water storage. Practical dimensions: 40cm height, 35cm diameter. Requires 3-4 days construction, 2 weeks drying, firing. Glaze interior for waterproofing (ash glaze adequate). Unglazed exterior acts as evaporative cooler (modest temperature reduction in arid climates).</p><h3>Cooking Vessels:</h3><p>Pots for cooking require even walls (5-8mm) for uniform heat distribution. Glazed interior prevents food from sticking. Unglazed or minimally-glazed exterior improves heat absorption. Creates thermal mass that moderates temperature during cooking.</p><h3>Food Storage Containers:</h3><p>Sealed vessels with tight-fitting lids for dry storage. High-fired (>1200°C) for strength. Glazed for pest prevention (smooth surface easier to clean). Typical sizes: 2-5 liters per container. Can be stacked for space efficiency.</p><h3>Tiles & Architectural Elements:</h3><p>Slab-built flat tiles (15-30cm square, 10-15mm thick) for roofing, flooring, or decorative applications. Large quantities can be produced if molds are created. Curved barrel tiles for roofing. Interlocking edge design for water shedding.</p></section><section id="common-mistakes"><h2>Common Mistakes & Solutions</h2><h3>Mistake 1: Air Bubbles in Clay</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Inadequate wedging leaves air pockets. During firing, air expands and bursts wall. Pot shatters mid-firing.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Wedge thoroughly (30+ repetitions). Break open sample clay to verify no air pockets visible.</p><h3>Mistake 2: Overly Thick Walls</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Beginners build thick walls for strength. Thick clay dries slowly; interior moisture remains while exterior is dry. Stress causes cracking.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Make thin walls (6-10mm). Thin-walled pots are actually stronger after firing (less stress buildup). Requires less material and fires faster.</p><h3>Mistake 3: Rapid Drying</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Placing pots in warm/dry location immediately after construction. Surface dries while interior is wet. Stress causes warping and cracking.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Dry slowly. Cover pots loosely with plastic sheet for first 24 hours (slows surface drying). Remove cover for final drying (additional 7-10 days).</p><h3>Mistake 4: Uneven Glaze Thickness</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Applying glaze too thick (3-5mm) or unevenly. Uneven glaze melts differently; results in uneven surface and potential glaze running off.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Apply 1-2mm glaze (thinner than appearance suggests). Dip pots briefly (1-2 seconds) rather than soaking. Test glaze thickness on sample piece before applying to finished work.</p></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="con-03-clay-earthworks.html">Clay & Earthworks</a><a href="con-04-energy-systems.html">Energy Systems (for Kiln Operation)</a><a href="cra-02-pottery-ceramics.html">Pottery Techniques</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
