Unlike dyes (soluble), pigments remain suspended in medium (oil, water, gum). High-quality pigments are: (1) finely divided particles, (2) consistent color, (3) non-toxic, (4) resistant to light/heat/chemicals, (5) opaque (covers background).</p><h3>Natural Pigment Sources</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Pigment<th scope="row">Color<th scope="row">Source<th scope="row">Permanence<th scope="row">Cost<tr><td>Carbon Black<td>Black<td>Soot, lamp black<td>Excellent<td>Very Low<tr><td>Iron Oxide<td>Red, Yellow, Brown<td>Mineral earth, rust<td>Excellent<td>Low<tr><td>Charcoal Black<td>Black<td>Burn wood<td>Good<td>Low<tr><td>Plant Indigo<td>Blue<td>Indigofera plant leaves<td>Good<td>Low<tr><td>Plant Madder<td>Red<td>Rubia root<td>Good<td>Medium<tr><td>Plant Woad<td>Blue<td>Isatis plant<td>Good<td>Low<tr><td>Plant Weld<td>Yellow<td>Reseda plant<td>Good<td>Low<tr><td>Cochineal<td>Red/Magenta<td>Cochineal insect<td>Excellent<td>High<tr><td>Ultramarine<td>Blue<td>Lapis lazuli (mineral)<td>Excellent<td>High</table></section><section id="carbon-black"><h2>Carbon Black Production</h2><p>Carbon black (pure amorphous carbon) is most reliable, permanent black pigment available. Produced via incomplete combustion of organic materials.</p><h3>Lamp Black Method</h3><ol><li><strong>Source:</strong> Oil, tallow, or pine resin burn in oxygen-limited environment<li><strong>Setup:</strong> Suspend flat dish/lamp above shallow tray. Lamp holds burning material (oil-soaked cloth, candle, pine splints)<li><strong>Collection:</strong> Carbon particles (soot) rise from flame, cool in air, settle in tray as fine black powder<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Run lamp continuously 4-8 hours to accumulate useful quantity (100-200g)<li><strong>Yield:</strong> ~10-20% of burned fuel becomes carbon black; remainder escapes as CO₂/smoke</ol><h3>Furnace Black Method (Larger Scale)</h3><ol><li><strong>Setup:</strong> Small furnace or kiln, draft control to restrict oxygen<li><strong>Fuel:</strong> Wood, coal dust, or oil spray into hot zone (700-1000°C)<li><strong>Combustion:</strong> Incomplete oxidation: 2C + O₂ → 2CO (incomplete), CO oxidizes slowly in cooler air: 2CO + O₂ → 2CO₂. Intermediate zone contains fine carbon particles<li><strong>Collection:</strong> Cyclone separator or settling chamber collects black powder. Gas exhaust through chimney<li><strong>Yield:</strong> 30-50% of input carbon becomes usable pigment</ol><h3>Properties</h3><p>Carbon black particles 10-500nm diameter (extremely fine). High oil absorption capacity (used as extender in paints). Does not fade or change color. Water-resistant. Cost: essentially free if produced on-site; price historically determined by fuel cost, not material rarity.</p></section><section id="iron-gall"><h2>Iron Gall Ink (Traditional)</h2><p>Iron gall ink (iron gallate) was standard writing ink for 1000+ years. Still superior to modern inks for permanence on parchment/paper.</p><h3>Chemistry</h3><p>Tannic acid (from oak galls) + iron(II) sulfate → dark blue-black ferrous gallate complex. Reaction: Fe²⁺ + tannic acid → Fe-tannate (blue-black complex). On paper, iron oxidizes to Fe³⁺ (black ferric gallate), even more permanent.</p><h3>Recipe (Traditional)</h3><ol><li><strong>Materials:</strong> Oak galls (wasp-induced growths on oak trees), iron(II) sulfate (ferrous sulfate, "copperas"), gum arabic (binder)<li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Crush 15g oak galls to fine powder. Dissolve 7g ferrous sulfate in 100mL water. Gum arabic 2g dissolved in 10mL warm water<li><strong>Mixing:</strong> Combine galls suspension + ferrous sulfate solution, allow reaction 24-48 hours (color darkens to blue-black). Filter through cloth to remove gall particles. Add gum solution to increase viscosity<li><strong>Result:</strong> ~100mL black ink, permanent to light and water after drying on paper</ol><h3>Historical Variations</h3><p>Medieval recipes added: (1) vitriol (sulfuric acid, increased permanence), (2) vinegar (slowed oxidation, improved shelf life), (3) alcohol (preservation, improved flow). These variations improved ink stability but similar base chemistry.</p></section><section id="plant-dyes"><h2>Plant-Based Dyes</h2><p>Plants produce colorful compounds suitable for inks if properly extracted and bound with pigment.</p><h3>Common Plant Dyes</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Plant<th scope="row">Part Used<th scope="row">Color<th scope="row">Extraction Method<th scope="row">Permanence<tr><td>Indigo<td>Leaves<td>Blue<td>Water maceration, fermentation<td>Good<tr><td>Madder<td>Root<td>Red<td>Boil in water 1-2 hours<td>Good<tr><td>Woad<td>Leaves<td>Blue<td>Fermentation of leaf juice<td>Good<tr><td>Weld<td>Whole plant<td>Yellow<td>Boil in water 1-2 hours<td>Good<tr><td>Walnut<td>Hull (outer covering)<td>Brown<td>Ferment in water 6 months<td>Excellent<tr><td>Cochineal<td>Insect (female body)<td>Red/Magenta<td>Boil in water with alum<td>Excellent<tr><td>Berries<td>Fruit<td>Purple/Red<td>Crush, ferment, extract<td>Fair<tr><td>Tea/Coffee<td>Leaves/Beans<td>Brown/Tan<td>Infuse in hot water<td>Fair</table><h3>Walnut Ink (Excellent Option)</h3><p>Walnut hulls contain high tannin content (similar to oak galls). Produces permanent brown ink:</p><ol><li>Collect walnut hulls (outer husks), dry completely<li>Ferment in water 6 months in sealed container (develops dark brown color from oxidation of tannins)<li>Filter, add ferrous sulfate (5% by volume) to darken/stabilize<li>Add gum arabic for viscosity<li>Result: permanent brown-black ink, water-resistant, archival quality</ol></section><section id="pigment-grinding"><h2>Pigment Grinding and Preparation</h2><p>Pigment particle size critically affects color intensity and application properties. Finer grinding = stronger color, better application.</p><h3>Hand Grinding Method</h3><ol><li><strong>Materials:</strong> Mortar and pestle (ceramic, not wood which absorbs pigment). Pigment powder (50-200g typical batch size)<li><strong>Technique:</strong> Add pigment to mortar. Use pestle with circular/grinding motion, pressure maintained throughout. Grind 30-60 minutes for fine powder<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Longer grinding = finer particles = more saturated color. Can continue 2-4 hours for very fine powder<li><strong>Transfer:</strong> Once finished, transfer to container. Pigment is now ready for mixing with binder</ol><h3>Mill Grinding (Larger Scale)</h3><p>Ball mill: ceramic cylinder filled partially with pigment and ceramic/steel balls. Rotating cylinder causes balls to tumble, grinding pigment to extremely fine particles (1-10 microns). Run time: 8-24 hours produces very fine, uniform pigment. Cost: building/operating mill higher than hand method, worthwhile for production scale.</p><h3>Particle Sizing</h3><p>Crude assessment: mix tiny amount pigment with water, observe color: (1) coarse (>10 microns) = pale/light color when diluted, (2) medium (1-10 microns) = moderate color, (3) fine (<1 micron) = intense, saturated color. Fine grinding preferred for inks (less pigment needed).</p></section><section id="binders"><h2>Binder Chemistry</h2><p>Binder holds pigment particles in suspension/dispersion and adheres to paper/parchment. Selection affects ink properties dramatically.</p><h3>Common Binders</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Binder<th scope="row">Composition<th scope="row">Properties<th scope="row">Application<tr><td>Gum Arabic<td>Tree resin (acacia)<td>Water-soluble, archival, slow drying<td>Inks, calligraphy<tr><td>Linseed Oil<td>Plant oil<td>Oil-soluble, fast drying (oxidation), flexible<td>Printing inks<tr><td>Egg Glair<td>Egg white protein<td>Water-soluble, archival, slow drying<td>Manuscript illumination<tr><td>Hide Glue<td>Collagen from animal skin<td>Hot-melt adhesive, historical<td>Old manuscript inks<tr><td>Shellac<td>Insect resin<td>Alcohol-soluble, hard, glossy<td>Varnish, specialty inks<tr><td>Gelatin<td>Animal collagen<td>Hot-water soluble, film-forming<td>Photo emulsion, old inks</table><h3>Gum Arabic Solution (Standard)</h3><ol><li>Dissolve 5-10g gum arabic powder in 100mL water<li>Heat gently (not boiling) until dissolved, 30-60 minutes<li>Cool completely, filter through cloth to remove particles<li>Use at 5-10% concentration in final ink (dilute with water as needed)</ol><p>Gum arabic dries slowly (hours to days) but produces crisp, waterproof writing on paper. High permanence - gum does not degrade over centuries.</p><h3>Linseed Oil Ink (Printing)</h3><ol><li>Heat linseed oil to 120-150°C (careful - oil flammable). Goal: partial oxidation (drying oil formation)<li>Cool to room temperature<li>Mix with pigment (30% pigment, 70% oil by weight)<li>Grind thoroughly in mortar to uniform paste</ol><p>Dries by oxidation (weeks) and becomes hard film. Superior for printing (adheres well to metal/stone rollers). Toxic fumes during heating - work outdoors.</p></section><section id="applications"><h2>Pen and Printing Applications</h2><h3>Writing Ink (Gum-Based)</h3><p>Mix carbon black or iron gall ink powder with gum arabic solution at 1-3% pigment concentration. Strain through fine cloth. Consistency should be thin (flows through pen) but dark (gives rich color). Test on scrap paper - if flows too slow, dilute with water; if too pale, add more pigment.</p><h3>Calligraphic Ink</h3><p>Same as above but with special attention to flow properties. Egg glair (egg white) historically used in medieval manuscripts (Cennino Cennini's 14th-century recipe) because it prevented feathering on parchment (ink bleeding into fibers). Recipe: mix 1 egg white with 1g gum arabic, 1g sugar, 5g carbon black. Age 24 hours before use.</p><h3>Printing Ink (Linseed Oil-Based)</h3><p>Linseed oil + pigment mixture applied to woodblock/metal plate via rollers, paper pressed on inked surface. Requires proper ink consistency (thick paste), proper paper pressure (uniform contact), and patience (multi-day drying). Traditional woodblock printing method.</p><h3>Stamp Ink (Quick-Drying)</h3><p>Problem: gum-based inks dry too slowly for stamping. Solution: use alcohol-soluble shellac or acetone-based solvents. Recipe: dissolve 5g shellac flakes in 50mL alcohol, add carbon black (2-5%) and gum (1-2%) as thickener. Dries in 1-2 minutes on paper.</p></section><section id="durability"><h2>Permanence and Archival Properties</h2><p>Recording critical information requires permanence. Some inks fade or degrade within years; others last centuries.</p><h3>Permanence Factors</h3><p><strong>Pigment:</strong> Carbon black = excellent (permanent). Iron gall = excellent (oxidizes to stable compound). Plant dyes = fair to good (some fade in light). Synthetic dyes = mixed (fugitive colors worst).</p><p><strong>Binder:</strong> Gum arabic = excellent (stable centuries). Linseed oil = excellent (hardens, resists water). Gelatin = good (slight yellowing over 100+ years). Hide glue = good (stiff, inflexible but permanent).</p><p><strong>Paper/substrate:</strong> Acid-free paper = essential for permanence. Acidic paper (most modern paper) causes ink to fade and paper to yellow/become brittle over 50-100 years. Historical rag paper (cotton/linen fiber) = excellent permanence if kept dry.</p><h3>Archival-Quality Ink</h3><p>Iron gall ink on acid-free rag paper = 500+ year permanence (proven by medieval manuscripts still readable). Carbon black + gum arabic on acid-free paper = similar permanence. Plant dyes fade faster (100-300 year range depending on plant/conditions). Avoid all synthetic dyes if permanence critical (fade in 20-50 years even on archival paper).</p></section><section id="storage"><h2>Storage and Preservation</h2><h3>Ink Storage</h3><ul><li><strong>Containers:</strong> Glass bottles preferred (stains plastic, especially gum-based inks). Ceramic also acceptable<li><strong>Sealing:</strong> Tight-sealing caps prevent evaporation. Gum inks dry thick if exposed to air - seal immediately after use<li><strong>Temperature:</strong> 10-25°C optimal. Avoid freezing (gum separates) and heat >30°C (promotes degradation)<li><strong>Light:</strong> Keep away from direct sunlight (some plant dye inks fade from UV). Opaque containers preferred</ul><p>Shelf life: gum-based inks 3-5 years if stored properly (gum hardens over time, losing fluidity). Oil-based inks years to decades (oxidation eventually hardens them completely). Iron gall ink improves with age (becomes darker as iron oxidizes) - historical practice was aging inks before use.</p><h3>Written Documents Storage</h3><ul><li><strong>Environment:</strong> 15-25°C, 30-50% humidity. Fluctuating temperature/humidity causes paper expansion/contraction, stress to ink/fiber<li><strong>Light:</strong> Keep out of direct sunlight (fades inks, yellows paper). Low-level ambient light acceptable<li><strong>Acid:</strong> Store in acid-free environment (acid-free folders/boxes). Lignin in wood pulp paper and cardboard is acidic - avoid direct contact<li><strong>Pests:</strong> Insects/fungi damage paper and inks. Keep dry, inspect regularly</ul><p>Properly stored archival documents last centuries. Iron gall ink documents from 1400s-1700s still perfectly readable. Acid-free paper expected to last 300-500 years minimum.</p></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="plant-chemistry.html">Plant Chemistry & Extraction</a> | <a href="metalworking.html">Metalworking</a> | <a href="record-keeping.html">Record Keeping & Archives</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
