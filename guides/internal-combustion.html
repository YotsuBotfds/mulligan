Piston moves down (expansion), reducing cylinder pressure below atmospheric. Air-fuel mixture flows through intake manifold into cylinder. Mixture compressed by intake valve closing at bottom-dead-center (BDC). Typical pressure at end of intake: 0.9 bar (slightly below atmospheric due to intake valve restrictions).</p><h3>Compression Stroke</h3><p>Both valves closed. Piston moves up, compressing air-fuel mixture. Compression ratio (initial volume / final volume) typically 8-12:1 for gasoline. Pressure and temperature rise: P × V^γ = constant (adiabatic process), pressure reaches 10-20 bar, temperature 300-400°C just before ignition. Spark plug ignites mixture near top-dead-center (TDC).</p><h3>Power (Expansion) Stroke</h3><p>Both valves closed initially. Combustion pressure from burning fuel pushes piston down, driving crankshaft (this is the only stroke producing power). Pressure drops from 50-100 bar at ignition to ~5 bar at BDC. Work output = integral of pressure × volume change. Exhaust valve cracks open near BDC to begin exhaust.</p><h3>Exhaust Stroke</h3><p>Exhaust valve fully open, intake valve closed. Piston moves up, pushing out burnt gases. Pressure slightly above atmospheric due to flow resistance in exhaust manifold. Residual exhaust gas (~5%) remains in clearance volume, diluting next charge (reduces flame speed, increases combustion time).</p></section><section id="four-stroke-svg"><h2>4-Stroke Cycle Diagram</h2><svg viewbox='0 0 700 380' xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="background:#2d2416" aria-label='Internal Combustion Engines diagram 1'><defs><lineargradient id="cylinderGrad" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="100%"><stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#888;stop-opacity:1"></stop><stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#333;stop-opacity:1"></stop></lineargradient></defs><text x="20" y="30" font-size="16" fill="#d4a574" font-weight="bold">Four-Stroke Engine Cycle</text><g id="intake"><rect x="20" y="80" width="120" height="180" fill="url(#cylinderGrad)" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2"></rect><circle cx="80" cy="140" r="30" fill="#f5f0e8" opacity="0.3" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="2"></circle><circle cx="50" cy="100" r="8" fill="#d4a574"></circle><text x="30" y="105" font-size="10" fill="#f5f0e8">IN</text><circle cx="110" cy="100" r="8" fill="#8b7355"></circle><text x="105" y="105" font-size="10" fill="#f5f0e8">EX</text><line x1="80" y1="170" x2="80" y2="250" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="3"></line><path d='M 70 250 Q 80 280 90 250' stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="3" fill="none"></path><text x="40" y="280" font-size="12" fill="#d4a574" font-weight="bold">1.

Exhaust port closed, intake port closed. Crankcase fills with air-fuel mixture (piston moving up pulls vacuum below piston through intake port). Cylinder above piston compresses mixture, ignites at TDC. Combustion drives piston down.</p><h3>Exhaust-Intake Stroke</h3><p>Piston moving down from TDC to BDC. When piston reaches exhaust port height (~70% of stroke), exhaust port opens, hot gas rushes out. Shortly after (at ~80% of stroke), intake port opens, fresh mixture entering crankcase and pushing into cylinder, scavenging out remaining exhaust gas. "Scavenging" efficiency critical: poor scavenging leaves excess exhaust that reduces power. Piston reaches BDC, both ports closed, cycle repeats.</p><h3>Advantages & Disadvantages</h3><p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Power stroke every crankshaft revolution (vs every 2 revolutions for 4-stroke) = high power density. Fewer parts, simpler construction, lower cost. Higher RPM capability.</p><p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Poor fuel economy (scavenging losses, incomplete exhaust evacuation). Higher emissions (fresh mixture exits with exhaust, pollutants reach tailpipe). Shorter engine life (higher mean piston speed). Lubrication: oil mixed with fuel (2-stroke oil) reduces efficiency. Used in small engines (chainsaws, outboards, motorcycles).</p></section><section id="fuel-systems"><h2>Fuel Systems & Carburetors</h2><h3>Carburetor Principle</h3><p>Carburetor atomizes fuel and mixes with air in correct proportion. Venturi (narrowing) in intake throat accelerates air, lowering pressure (Bernoulli effect). Low pressure sucks fuel from bowl through fuel metering orifice, atomizing it into moving air stream. Throttle butterfly controls air flow and engine load. Air-fuel ratio: stoichiometric (14.7:1 by mass for gasoline) provides complete combustion.</p><h3>Carburetor Circuits</h3><p><strong>Idle circuit:</strong> Small fixed orifice (idle jet) bypasses main jet when throttle closed. Maintains engine running without stalling. Idle air screw adjusts air bypass (leaning enriches mixture by blocking air). Typically 1000-1200 RPM target.</p><p><strong>Main jet:</strong> Controls fuel flow at part and full throttle. Larger jet = richer mixture, more fuel for more power but worse economy and more exhaust. Jet size stamped (e.g., 150 jet = 1.50mm orifice).</p><p><strong>Power valve/needling:</strong> Some carburetors vary needle position (lean at part throttle, rich at full throttle) for efficiency and power. Vacuum-operated power valve enriches mixture when load is high.</p><h3>Fuel Injection vs Carburetor</h3><p><strong>Carburetor:</strong> Cheaper, simpler, no electricity needed. Difficulty in cold starts (carburetor needs to be manually enriched). Cannot adapt fuel delivery to engine speed/load dynamically.</p><p><strong>Fuel injection:</strong> Electronically controlled, injector sprays fuel directly into cylinder or intake port. Precise timing and quantity adjustable by computer. Better cold start, better economy, lower emissions. Requires electrical system and engine sensors. More reliable and efficient but more complex.</p></section><section id="ignition"><h2>Ignition Systems</h2><h3>Spark Plug Ignition</h3><p>Spark plug creates electric arc between center and ground electrodes, ionizing gap (5mm). Arc temperature 30,000 K initiates chemical reaction (combustion). Spark duration critical: too short = incomplete ignition (misfire), too long = heat loss to electrodes (wasted energy). Typical spark duration 1-2 milliseconds.</p><h3>Ignition Timing</h3><p>Spark must occur before piston reaches TDC (advanced ignition) to allow combustion pressure to build while piston moves down (extracting work). Typical advance: 20-40 degrees of crankshaft rotation before TDC. Too early = detonation (knocking), pressure spike before piston moves down (mechanical stress, reduced efficiency). Too late = weak power, unburned fuel exits exhaust.</p><h3>Ignition System Types</h3><p><strong>Magneto:</strong> Generator creates high voltage (15-25 kV) without battery. Magnetic rotor spins in coil, inducing AC current. Capacitor and points switch the circuit, creating primary current collapse and secondary high voltage. Used in small engines (lawnmowers, generators) due to simplicity and reliability without battery.</p><p><strong>Battery-coil ignition:</strong> Battery powers ignition coil (transformer). Points or electronic switch interrupt primary current, inducing high voltage secondary (20-50 kV). Dwell angle (percentage of time points closed) critical: too low = weak spark, too high = coil overheating.</p><p><strong>Electronic ignition:</strong> Transistor or microprocessor controls primary current switching. More precise timing, higher voltage, longer spark duration. Can vary ignition timing with engine speed and load (knock sensors feed back detonation, retarding timing to prevent it).</p></section><section id="timing"><h2>Timing & Valve Control</h2><h3>Valve Timing Diagram</h3><p>Intake valve opens 10-20 degrees before TDC (early intake), closes 40-80 degrees after BDC (late closing). Overlap period allows both valves open briefly, improving cylinder filling through momentum scavenging. Exhaust valve opens 40-80 degrees before BDC (early exhaust), closes 10-20 degrees after TDC. Late intake and early exhaust closing optimize power.</p><h3>Cam Shaft Design</h3><p>Cam profile (shape) determines valve lift and duration. Base circle: cam not lifting valve. Ramp: gradual lift acceleration (reduces valve train impact stress). Nose: peak lift. Return: gradual valve closing. Steeper ramps = faster opening/closing = higher lift speed but higher stress on valve train. Large cam profiles (high lift, long duration) increase maximum RPM capability and power but reduce low-RPM torque and idle stability.</p><h3>Variable Valve Timing</h3><p>Adjustable cam timing (advancing or retarding relative to crankshaft) optimizes power and efficiency across speed range. Low RPM: retarded timing improves low-RPM torque. High RPM: advanced timing captures maximum pressure during expansion stroke. Hydraulic or electromagnetic actuators adjust cam sprocket angle by 25-40 degrees crankshaft rotation.</p></section><section id="lubrication"><h2>Lubrication Systems</h2><h3>Lubrication Oil Functions</h3><p>(1) Reduces friction between moving parts (piston/bore, bearing/crankshaft). (2) Carries heat away from hot spots. (3) Cleans (detergents suspend carbon and sludge). (4) Protects from corrosion (anti-corrosion additives). (5) Reduces wear rate by 1000× compared to dry friction.</p><h3>Oil Viscosity & Ratings</h3><p>Viscosity (thickness) measured in centiStokes (cSt). Higher viscosity = thicker oil. SAE ratings (30W, 40, 10W-40, etc.) specify pour point and viscosity at 100°C. Multigrade oils (e.g., 10W-40): flow at cold temperature like 10W single-grade, maintain viscosity at 100°C like 40-grade. Most modern engines use multigrade (10W-30, 0W-20) for cold starting and efficiency.</p><h3>Oil Change Interval</h3><p>Oil degrades over time: anti-wear additives deplete, detergents saturate, viscosity breaks down. Recommended interval 3,000-5,000 miles for conventional oil (5,000-7,000 for synthetic). Extended drain intervals with quality synthetic oil reduce maintenance frequency but cost more upfront.</p><h3>Splash vs Pressure Lubrication</h3><p><strong>Splash lubrication:</strong> Oil in pan scoops up by rotating crankshaft, splashing onto bearings and cylinder walls. Simple, cheap, suitable for small engines. Insufficient for high-RPM or heavily loaded engines.</p><p><strong>Pressure lubrication:</strong> Oil pump pressurizes oil, feeding galleries throughout engine. Maintains constant lubrication regardless of RPM. Used in all modern automotive engines.</p></section><section id="cooling"><h2>Cooling Systems</h2><h3>Cooling Methods</h3><p><strong>Air-cooling:</strong> Fins on engine block dissipate heat to airflow. Simple, cheap, no coolant. Difficulty maintaining uniform temperature: fins far from bore run hot, fins near air intake run cool. Used in small engines, motorcycles, older vehicles.</p><p><strong>Liquid-cooling:</strong> Coolant (water + antifreeze) circulates through passages cast in engine block, absorbing heat. Cooler dissipates heat to air through fan. Thermostat maintains operating temperature (80-100°C). Better temperature control, higher power density, more complex plumbing, heavier.</p><h3>Cooling System Components</h3><p><strong>Radiator:</strong> Thin aluminum tubes with fins. Coolant enters hot at ~95°C, exits cooled at ~80°C. Airflow (natural draft or fan-forced) determines cooling capacity.</p><p><strong>Water pump:</strong> Centrifugal pump driven by engine crankshaft. Creates circulation pressure. Typical flow 10-50 gallons per minute depending on engine size.</p><p><strong>Thermostat:</strong> Wax-element valve maintains coolant temperature. Opens at threshold (e.g., 85°C) to allow circulation. Closed thermostat = high temperature until engine warms. Stuck open = engine never reaches operating temperature (poor economy, high emissions).</p><p><strong>Fan:</strong> Mechanical (belt-driven, engages at temperature) or electric (thermostat-controlled, on/off). Electric fans improve efficiency (only run when needed).</p></section><section id="troubleshooting"><h2>Troubleshooting & Maintenance</h2><h3>Engine Won't Start</h3><p>Check: Fuel (is there fuel in tank? Filter clogged?). Spark (remove plug, ground to block, see if spark jumps gap when cranking). Compression (remove plug, feel pressure when cranking—should be significant). If no fuel: fuel pump bad or line blocked. If no spark: ignition coil bad, points gap incorrect, battery dead. If no compression: valve stuck closed, piston ring broken, head gasket blown.</p><h3>Weak Power or Stalling</h3><p>Fuel system: carburetor clogged, fuel filter clogged, fuel pump weak (insufficient pressure). Ignition: wrong spark plug (too hot = preignition, too cold = fouling), timing advanced/retarded incorrectly. Valve problems: stuck valves, burned valve, improper valve clearance (too tight = valve doesn't fully close, loses compression). Compression: leaking head gasket, broken ring, carbon buildup (reduce compression ratio).</p><h3>Overheating</h3><p>Check coolant level first. Low level = insufficient cooling capacity. Thermostat stuck closed (coolant doesn't circulate) or fan not working. Radiator clogged (scale buildup restricts flow). Water pump cavitation (pump spinning fast but not moving fluid). Engine timing advanced too much (higher combustion temperatures). Worn bearings increase friction and heat generation.</p><h3>Excessive Oil Consumption</h3><p>Burning oil (blue exhaust smoke): worn piston rings let oil past into combustion chamber, worn valve seals leak oil into intake. Leaking oil (spots under engine): worn gaskets, cracked block. Running engine too hot increases evaporation loss. Using wrong oil viscosity (too thin evaporates faster).</p></section><section id="alternative-fuels"><h2>Alternative Fuels</h2><h3>Wood Gas (Gasification)</h3><p>Wood or charcoal heated in low-oxygen environment produces combustible gas (carbon monoxide, hydrogen, methane mixture). Can fuel gasoline engine with modifications: cooling/filtering/carburetor adjustment. Energy density 1/3 gasoline (requires larger fuel tank). Cold start difficult. Ash accumulation requires frequent cleaning. Popular in wartime and developing countries with fuel shortages.</p><h3>Biodiesel</h3><p>Vegetable oil or animal fat transesterified (treated with catalyst) to create diesel-like fuel. Pure biodiesel (B100) or blended (B20 = 20% biodiesel + 80% diesel). Higher cetane number (ignites easier than diesel). Disadvantage: higher viscosity cold weather (requires heating), some engines need fuel filter upgrades (biodiesel dissolves gums).</p><h3>Ethanol (E10/E85)</h3><p>Ethanol (grain alcohol) blended with gasoline. E10 (10% ethanol) approved for all engines with no modification. E85 (85% ethanol) requires flex-fuel vehicle (fuel injection and ignition timing adjusted). Ethanol: higher octane (prevents knocking), cooler combustion temperature, hygroscopic (absorbs water in fuel system). Less energy per volume (15% less than gasoline).</p><h3>Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)</h3><p>Methane compressed to 200+ bar in high-pressure cylinder. Cleaner burning than gasoline (lower emissions). Engine modified: fuel injector sprays high-pressure gas, ignition timing advanced (faster flame speed). Energy density lower (smaller tank range). Cost-effective in fleet applications (dedicated stations).</p></section><div class="warning"><strong>Safety Warning:</strong> Gasoline is extremely flammable—vapor ignites at 0.4% concentration. Fuel system maintenance only with engine cold and battery disconnected. Never create fuel system pressure without proper tools; fuel under pressure escapes with extreme velocity (injection hazard). Exhaust is toxic (carbon monoxide)—never run engine indoors without ventilation. Engine coolant is poisonous—clean up spills and keep away from animals.</strong></div><div class="tip"><strong>Maintenance Tip:</strong> Check spark plugs annually. Gap should be manufacturer spec (usually 0.8-1.2mm). Excessive gap (>1.5mm) reduces spark intensity. Carbon fouling (oily residue on electrode) indicates running too rich or low temperature. New plugs cost $1-3 each; improper plugs cause rough running and fuel wasting.</tip><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="vehicle-conversion.html">Vehicle Conversion</a><a href="automotive-alternator-repurposing.html">Alternator Repurposing</a><a href="hydroelectric.html">Hydroelectric Systems</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
