Standard insulation ratings: 60°C (older), 75°C (common), 90°C (high-temp). Higher temperature rating allows higher ampacity in same wire size.</p><h3>Copper vs Aluminum Wire</h3><p>Copper has lower resistance than aluminum: ~1.68 µΩ·cm vs 2.82 µΩ·cm. Using same size, aluminum carries 60-70% the current of copper at same temperature. Aluminum requires larger size than copper for equivalent ampacity. Aluminum cost is 30-40% lower but volume/weight disadvantage often makes copper preferable. Aluminum connections require corrosion-resistant hardware to prevent galvanic corrosion at dissimilar-metal contacts.</p><h3>Voltage Drop Calculations</h3><p>Voltage drop (V) = 2 × ρ × I × L / A, where ρ is resistivity (copper: 1.68×10⁻⁸ Ω·m), I is current, L is one-way conductor length, A is cross-sectional area. For practical use: Voltage drop (%) = (2 × I × L × K) / (V × A) where K=10.4 for copper (metric units). Maximum voltage drop: 3% for feeder, 5% for branch circuit total. A 20A circuit 100 feet long with 10 AWG wire drops 4.6V (5.75%), exceeding code limit; use 8 AWG instead (2.9% drop).</p><h3>Continuous vs Non-Continuous Load</h3><p>Continuous load (on 3+ hours): wire and breaker must be sized to 125% of continuous load. A 16A continuous load needs 16 × 1.25 = 20A wire and breaker minimum. Non-continuous load: size to actual load. This protects wire and breaker from overheating when heavily loaded for extended periods.</p></section><section id="ampacity"><h2>Ampacity Tables & Derating</h2><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Wire Size (AWG)</th><th scope="col">Copper Ω/km</th><th scope="col">60°C Insulation</th><th scope="col">75°C Insulation</th><th scope="col">90°C Insulation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>14</td><td>9.80</td><td>15A</td><td>15A</td><td>20A</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>4.88</td><td>20A</td><td>20A</td><td>30A</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>3.08</td><td>30A</td><td>30A</td><td>40A</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>1.93</td><td>40A</td><td>50A</td><td>55A</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>1.21</td><td>55A</td><td>65A</td><td>75A</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>0.76</td><td>70A</td><td>85A</td><td>95A</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>0.49</td><td>95A</td><td>115A</td><td>130A</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.39</td><td>110A</td><td>130A</td><td>150A</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Derating Factors</h3><p>Wire ampacity is reduced if ambient temperature exceeds 30°C or if more than 3 conductors are in same conduit. Ambient temperature derating: multiply base ampacity by factor (e.g., 0.82 at 40°C for 75°C insulation). Bundled conductor derating: 3-6 conductors = 80% derating, 7-9 = 70%, 10-20 = 50%, 21-30 = 45%. Examples: four 12 AWG wires in tight conduit at 40°C: base 20A × 0.82 × 0.80 = 13A maximum.</p><h3>Practical Wire Selection</h3><p>Circuit breaker and wire sizing: breaker must be rated for wire ampacity, not load. A 20A breaker with 12 AWG wire (75°C = 20A ampacity) is correct. Using 14 AWG wire (15A ampacity) with 20A breaker is code violation. Always size wire to breaker ampacity, then select breaker for load (within wire's safe limit).</p></section><section id="circuit-design"><h2>Circuit Design Principles</h2><h3>Series vs Parallel Circuits</h3><p><strong>Series:</strong> Current same throughout. Resistances add: Total R = R₁ + R₂ + R₃. Voltage divides across resistances. One failed component breaks circuit. Used for additive effects (indicator lights).</p><p><strong>Parallel:</strong> Voltage same across each branch. Currents add: Total I = I₁ + I₂ + I₃. Conductances add: 1/Total R = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + 1/R₃. One failed component doesn't affect others. Most power distribution uses parallel (outlets and light fixtures independently switched).</p><h3>Circuit Breaker Selectivity</h3><p>Breaker upstream (main) should trip slower than downstream (branch). Coordination ensures fault damages smallest portion of circuit. Time-current curves show this: main breaker at 200A curves right of 20A breaker curve. Selective coordination critical in industrial systems; residential typically overlooks this detail.</p><h3>Load Calculation for Homes</h3><p>Residential load estimation: lighting 3 VA/ft², general outlets 1.5 VA/ft² (minimum), kitchen 1500 VA per outlet, dryer 5000 VA, electric range 8000-12000 VA, air conditioner 15,000+ VA. Total for 2000 ft² home: lighting 6000 + outlets 3000 + kitchen 3000 + misc 4000 = 16000 VA minimum. Add diversity factor 0.7 for practical load = 11,200 W. Breaker panel 100-150 A typical for modern home.</p></section><section id="fuses"><h2>Fuses & Breakers</h2><h3>Fuse Operation</h3><p>Fuse is sacrificial conductor that melts when current exceeds rating, opening circuit. I²t characteristic determines when fuse melts: current must exceed rating for specific time. Standard fuses: fast-blow melts instantly at ~1.5× rated current; slow-blow (time-delay) tolerates brief overcurrent (like motor inrush) but opens at ~1.35× rated current sustained. Fast-blow better for electronics; slow-blow for motors and inductive loads.</p><h3>Breaker Operation</h3><p>Thermal-magnetic breaker: bimetallic strip heats with sustained high current (thermal trip), magnetic coil pulls armature at extreme current (magnetic trip, typically 10× breaker rating). Thermal element provides inverse-time characteristic (higher overcurrent trips faster). Magnetic trip for instantaneous fault protection. Circuit breaker reusable; fuse must be replaced.</p><h3>Breaker Amp Rating Selection</h3><p>Breaker must not exceed wire ampacity. Circuit with 12 AWG wire rated 20A (75°C) uses maximum 20A breaker. Load current should not exceed 80% of breaker rating for continuous operation (20A breaker × 0.8 = 16A max continuous load). Non-continuous load can be 100% of breaker rating. Select breaker to match wire and protect load from sustained overload.</p><h3>Series Rating & Coordination</h3><p>Series rating: downstream breaker coordinates with upstream to limit arc energy during fault. Improves safety and reduces panel damage. Some older panels lack series rating; main breaker must protect all downstream breakers.</p></section><section id="grounding"><h2>Grounding & Bonding</h2><h3>Grounding Purpose</h3><p>Equipment grounding provides low-resistance path for fault current to return to source, allowing breaker to trip. Bonding connects metal enclosures and equipment frames to ground, equalizing potential and preventing shock hazard. Earth grounding (service entrance to earth electrode) provides reference potential for system. All three types essential for safety.</p><h3>Grounding Wire Sizing</h3><p>Equipment ground conductor (green or bare) sized according to breaker amperage: 15-20A breaker = 14 AWG minimum, 25-30A = 12 AWG, 40-60A = 10 AWG, 70-100A = 8 AWG, 125-200A = 6 AWG. Ground conductor runs with circuit conductors in same conduit or raceway—never in separate conduit (increases impedance, slows fault clearing).</p><h3>Grounding Electrode System</h3><p>Buried copper or copper-clad steel rod 8-10 feet deep. Two electrodes required if first one has >25Ω resistance. Connected with 6 AWG copper wire minimum to service entrance panel. Concrete-encased electrode (rebar in foundation) or ring electrode (loop around building buried 2.5 feet deep) alternative methods. Grounding resistance target <25Ω.</p><h3>GFCI & AFCI Protection</h3><p>Ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI): detects imbalance between hot and neutral (indicating fault to ground). Trips at 4-6 mA, faster than breaker. Protects against electrocution in wet areas (bathrooms, kitchens). Arc-fault circuit interrupter (AFCI): detects arcing faults, prevents fires. Required in bedrooms by code. Can be outlet type or breaker type protecting entire circuit.</p></section><section id="junctions"><h2>Junction Boxes & Conduit</h2><h3>Junction Box Sizing</h3><p>Junction boxes must contain all wire bends, splices, and terminations without crushing insulation. Size determined by: number and size of conductors, number of bends, whether box serves as pull point. Minimum: 4"×4"×2.125" for one 12 AWG wire. Formula for maximum fill: sum of conductor volumes ≤ 40% of box volume. Conductors ≥ 6 AWG use de-rating tables.</p><h3>Wire Fill & Conductor Spacing</h3><p>Bend radius determines space needed: conductors 14-10 AWG need 6×wire diameter bend radius minimum (12 times if inside conduit). Larger conductors need proportionally larger bends. Tight bends damage insulation and create failure points. Multiple conductors in tight space generate heat; use larger conduit to improve cooling.</p><h3>Conduit Types & Selection</h3><p><strong>Rigid metal (RMC):</strong> Heavy steel, excellent mechanical protection. Requires fittings and locknuts. More difficult to install but very durable in harsh environments.</p><p><strong>Electrical metallic tubing (EMT):</strong> Thin-wall steel, lighter than RMC, easier to bend. Common in commercial. Requires bushings at outlets to protect wire insulation from sharp edges.</p><p><strong>PVC:</strong> Non-metallic, no corrosion, good in wet areas. Cannot be used in locations exceeding 50°C. Requires bonding jumper across conduit to maintain ground continuity.</p><p><strong>Flexible metal (AC/BX):</strong> Corrugated metal spiral. Easy to route around obstacles. Serves as ground path itself. Common in residential wiring.</p></section><section id="outlets"><h2>Outlet Wiring</h2><h3>NEMA Outlet Configurations</h3><p><strong>5-15R (standard household):</strong> 120V, 15A. Two vertical slots (hot/neutral) and round hole (ground). Used in every room.</p><p><strong>5-20R:</strong> 120V, 20A. Horizontal neutral slot accepts both 15A and 20A plugs. Requires 12 AWG wire and 20A breaker.</p><p><strong>6-20R:</strong> 240V, 20A. Commonly used for heavy appliances. Single large slot and smaller slot plus ground.</p><p><strong>14-30R:</strong> 240V, 30A. Electric range typical use. Requires 10 AWG wire and 30A breaker minimum.</p><h3>Proper Outlet Installation</h3><p>Hot wire (typically black) connects to brass terminal (hot side, right), neutral (white) to silver terminal (left), ground (green/bare) to green screw. Test with multimeter: should read 120V between hot and neutral, 120V between hot and ground, 0V between neutral and ground. Reversed polarity (hot/neutral swapped) is code violation and shock hazard.</p><h3>Duplex Outlet Wiring</h3><p>Standard duplex (two outlets stacked) wired with incoming wires to top outlet, pigtail jumpers from top to bottom (or incoming wires split to both). Test jumpers for proper connection. Some outlets have separate circuits for each side (split-wired); require careful jumper configuration or disconnection tab removal.</p><h3>Switch Wiring</h3><p>Switch always breaks (opens) hot conductor. Hot wire to switch, return wire from switch to light fixture. Neutral goes directly to fixture without switch. Ground from source to fixture and switch. Three-way switch: three terminals (common, top, bottom); requires 3-conductor cable between switches. Four-way switch: same as three-way but in middle of circuit, allowing control from 3+ locations.</p></section><section id="three-phase"><h2>Three-Phase Wiring</h2><h3>Three-Phase Voltage & Current Relationships</h3><p>Three-phase system uses three separate AC voltages 120 degrees apart. Line-to-line voltage = √3 × Phase voltage. Typical: 480V line-to-line, 277V line-to-neutral. Three-phase power (balanced): P = √3 × V × I × PF, where V is line-to-line voltage, I is line current, PF is power factor. A 480V three-phase circuit with 10A per phase and unity PF delivers: P = 1.732 × 480 × 10 × 1.0 = 8,294 W.</p><h3>Delta vs Wye Configuration</h3><p><strong>Delta:</strong> Three phases connected end-to-end forming triangle. No neutral (4-wire delta rare). Line-to-line voltage = phase voltage. Used in older systems and industrial high-voltage distribution.</p><p><strong>Wye (star):</strong> Three phases meet at central point (neutral). Neutral provides return path. Line-to-neutral voltage = phase voltage / √3 = 0.577 × line-to-line voltage. Most common in modern systems. 480V/277V Wye typical commercial.</p><h3>Single-Phase from Three-Phase</h3><p>Two of three phase legs provide single-phase voltage equal to line-to-line voltage. A 480V three-phase system provides 480V single-phase by using two phases, no neutral. Common for large motors and loads. Cannot use single-phase 277V (line-to-neutral) loads with three-phase only service—requires step-down transformer.</p></section><section id="voltage-drop"><h2>Voltage Drop Calculations & Effects</h2><h3>Voltage Drop Formula & Application</h3><p>Two-wire circuit: VD = (2 × K × I × L) / A where K = 10.4 (copper, SI), I is amperes, L is length one-way (feet), A is wire area in circular mils (or multiply by 0.01639 if using mm²). Three-phase: VD = (√3 × K × I × L) / A. Example: 20A circuit 150 feet with 12 AWG (6530 circular mils): VD = (2 × 10.4 × 20 × 150) / 6530 = 9.5V (7.9% drop, exceeds 5% code limit).</p><h3>Effect on Load Devices</h3><p>Motor starting current 5-7× running current; voltage drop at start can be extreme. 3% voltage drop during steady-state means 10-15% during motor start, reducing starting torque and speed. Lights dimming indicates excessive voltage drop. Motor overheating possible if sustained voltage drop >5%. Size feeders generously for circuits with motor or large inductive loads.</p><h3>Correction Methods</h3><p>Use larger wire (next size up cuts resistance ~20%). Reduce circuit length (relocate breaker panel). Use higher voltage for distribution (higher voltage = same power at lower current and voltage drop). Voltage regulator (step-up transformer) restores voltage at load end but adds cost and losses. Remote disconnect: run small-gauge control wire to disconnect rather than full-size power wire.</p></section><section id="basic-circuit"><h2>Basic Circuit SVG</h2><svg viewbox='0 0 600 400' xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="background:#1a2e1a" aria-label='Electrical Wiring diagram 1'><defs><lineargradient id="wireGrad" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="100%"><stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#d4a574;stop-opacity:1"></stop><stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#8b7355;stop-opacity:1"></stop></lineargradient></defs><text x="20" y="30" font-size="18" fill="#d4a574" font-weight="bold">Basic Circuit: Light and Switch</text><rect x="50" y="80" width="40" height="30" fill="#b8956a" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="2"></rect><text x="55" y="105" font-size="12" fill="#1a2e1a" font-weight="bold">Breaker</text><line x1="70" y1="50" x2="70" y2="80" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="3"></line><text x="40" y="65" font-size="11" fill="#d4a574">120V</text><line x1="90" y1="95" x2="150" y2="95" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="3"></line><text x="110" y="85" font-size="11" fill="#d4a574">Hot (Black)</text><rect x="150" y="80" width="40" height="30" fill="#b8956a" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="2"></rect><text x="155" y="105" font-size="11" fill="#1a2e1a" font-weight="bold">Switch</text><line x1="190" y1="95" x2="250" y2="95" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="3"></line><text x="200" y="85" font-size="11" fill="#d4a574">To Fixture</text><circle cx="300" cy="95" r="20" fill="none" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="3"></circle><circle cx="300" cy="95" r="15" fill="#f5f0e8" opacity="0.3"></circle><text x="290" y="100" font-size="12" fill="#d4a574" font-weight="bold">L</text><line x1="300" y1="115" x2="300" y2="200" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="3"></line><line x1="70" y1="50" x2="70" y2="20" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="3"></line><line x1="70" y1="20" x2="350" y2="20" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="3"></line><line x1="350" y1="20" x2="350" y2="200" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="3"></line><text x="330" y="110" font-size="11" fill="#d4a574">Neutral (White)</text><line x1="300" y1="200" x2="350" y2="200" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="3"></line><circle cx="100" cy="300" r="20" fill="none" stroke="#8b5a3c" stroke-width="3"></circle><text x="90" y="305" font-size="11" fill="#8b5a3c" font-weight="bold">GND</text><line x1="100" y1="320" x2="100" y2="360" stroke="#8b5a3c" stroke-width="3" stroke-dasharray="5,5"></line><text x="20" y="320" font-size="11" fill="#8b5a3c">Ground to Earth Electrode</text><path d='M 95 360 L 105 360 M 90 370 L 110 370 M 85 380 L 115 380' stroke="#8b5a3c" stroke-width="2"></path><text x="320" y="350" font-size="13" fill="#d4a574" font-weight="bold">Circuit Protection Sequence:</text><text x="320" y="375" font-size="11" fill="#d4a574">1.
