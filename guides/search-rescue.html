Useful in open terrain or fields. Requires coordination - all searchers maintain alignment. Visual coverage excellent if properly spaced. Time-intensive for large areas.</p><h3>Sweep Search</h3><p>Searchers fan out from central location in widening circles. Useful when approximate lost person location known. Systematic expansion ensures all nearby terrain covered. Less effective in forests with poor visibility. Difficult to maintain formation in rough terrain.</p><h3>Quadrant Search</h3><p>Divide area into four quadrants from central point. Searchers systematically cover each quadrant. Allows coordination of multiple teams. Useful for large areas. Teams rotate through quadrants ensuring complete coverage.</p><h3>Route Search</h3><p>Follow likely travel routes: trails, ridgelines, water courses, power lines. Lost persons often follow distinctive terrain features. Route searches efficient when patterns of lost person behavior understood. Can be combined with grid or sweep searching.</p><h3>Probability Theory</h3><p>Allocate search resources to areas where lost person most likely found. Factors: victim age (young children tend to stay closer), victim condition (injured persons move less), terrain difficulty (steep areas less likely), time missing (expands search area over time), victim behavior patterns.</p><h3>Search Coordination</h3><p>Coordinate with agencies (police, fire, SAR groups). Establish incident command center, assign search leaders, divide area into manageable sections, track searched areas (prevent duplication), assign priorities (high probability areas first), establish timeline for expanding search.</p></section><section id="signaling"><h2>Signaling Methods</h2><p>Attract rescuer attention through visible and audible signals.</p><h3>Visual Signals</h3><p>Signal fires: three fires in triangle pattern international distress signal. Large smoke visible 20+ miles in clear conditions. Bright colors: clothing hung in trees, cloth markers, reflective materials. Ground-to-air signals: large letters/numbers arranged in ground (50+ feet), visible from aircraft. Mirrors: bright reflection visible from distance. Movement: waving, jumping attracts eye.</p><h3>Audio Signals</h3><p>Three short sounds = distress signal (three whistle blasts, three gunshots, three horn blasts). Shelter sound: shout periodically. Echoes help searchers locate source. Maintain vocal cords - don't exhaust shouting (spaced calls more effective than continuous yelling).</p><h3>Light Signals</h3><p>Flashlight: three short flashes international distress. Use during night. Strobe effects more visible (on-off-on-off pattern). Reflectors at night: shine light toward aircraft. Glow sticks: cheap, long-lasting light source. Fire provides continuous light signal at night.</p><h3>Ground-to-Air Signals</h3><p>Large V = need help, X = cannot proceed, SOS = extreme distress (three dots-three dashes-three dots in Morse), F = need food/water, L = need medical attention. Arrange using rocks, logs, clothing - size 50+ feet. Bright colors more visible: orange, red, yellow. Multiple signals increase chances of recognition.</p><h3>Electronic Signals</h3><p>If satellite communicator available: transmit distress signal with location. Personal locator beacon: activates search and rescue. Cellular phone: call emergency services if coverage available. Electronic devices preserve voice/location data better than physical signals.</p></section><section id="assessment"><h2>Patient Assessment</h2><p>Proper assessment prevents secondary injuries and guides treatment priorities.</p><h3>Scene Safety</h3><p>Ensure scene safe before approaching: no hazardous materials, no ongoing threats, electrical hazards secured, unstable structures avoided. Rescuer injury creates more victims - prioritize own safety.</p><h3>Primary Survey (Life Threats)</h3><ol><li><strong>Responsiveness:</strong> Tap shoulders, shout "Are you okay?" Gauge consciousness level.</li><li><strong>Airway:</strong> Open airway, listen for breathing. Clear airway of obstructions.</li><li><strong>Breathing:</strong> Check for chest rise, listen for breathing sounds. If not breathing, begin rescue breathing if trained.</li><li><strong>Circulation:</strong> Check pulse (carotid artery in neck). If no pulse and trained, begin CPR.</li><li><strong>Catastrophic Bleeding:</strong> Control massive bleeding with direct pressure and tourniquet if needed.</li></ol><h3>Secondary Survey (Injuries)</h3><p>Head: check for consciousness, pupil response, drainage from ears/nose. Neck/Spine: assume spinal injury from mechanism (falls, high-impact trauma). Immobilize neck/spine immediately. Chest: check for rib fractures, breathing difficulty, shock signs. Abdomen: palpate for distension/tenderness (internal bleeding). Extremities: check for fractures, dislocations, pulses. Skin: color (pale = shock), temperature, moisture.</p><h3>Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Component</th><th scope="row">Score</th><th scope="row">Meaning</th></tr><tr><td>Eye Opening</td><td>1-4</td><td>Spontaneous best, no response worst</td></tr><tr><td>Verbal Response</td><td>1-5</td><td>Oriented best, no words worst</td></tr><tr><td>Motor Response</td><td>1-6</td><td>Obeys commands best, no movement worst</td></tr></table><p>Total GCS 3-15. Score 8 or below = serious injury, requires medical care immediately. Score 13+ = mild injury.</p><h3>Shock Recognition</h3><p>Signs: rapid weak pulse, pale/cold skin, rapid breathing, anxiety, confusion, dilated pupils. Shock = inadequate blood flow to tissues. Can be fatal if untreated. Treatment: lay flat with feet elevated, keep warm, monitor closely, transport to medical care immediately.</p></section><section id="extraction"><h2>Extraction Techniques</h2><p>Moving injured persons safely requires proper technique to prevent secondary injury.</p><h3>Spinal Precautions</h3><p>If spinal injury suspected: immobilize neck/spine, move as single unit, avoid twisting. Improvise spine board from wide board or lashed poles. Log-roll technique: keep body straight, roll 90 degrees as unit. Four people minimum (one per extremity, one for head/neck).</p><h3>Carrying Techniques</h3><p>Hands-and-knees carry: one rescuer. Use when distance short and victim not seriously injured. Fireman carry: victim over shoulder, fireman position. Useful for conscious victims or unconscious victims without spine injury. Two-rescuer carry: one per side, linked beneath victim. Most stable for conscious victims.</p><h3>Litter Transport</h3><p>Litter (improvised stretcher) allows injured to be transported without rescuers bearing weight. Essential for long distances. Construction details in next section. Minimum four carriers (one per corner) to prevent tilting and victim shifting.</p><h3>Difficult Terrain Extraction</h3><p>Steep slopes: maintain control with ropes. Vertical extraction: use fixed ropes, secure victim to litter. Water rescue: keep airway above water, support cervical spine if trauma suspected. Cave rescue: minimize movement, assess route before extraction begins.</p></section><section id="litter"><h2>Litter Construction</h2><p>Improvised litter allows efficient casualty transport over distance.</p><h3>Basic Litter Design</h3><svg viewbox='0 0 500 400' xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label='Search and Rescue Operations diagram 1'><rect width="500" height="400" fill="#2d2416"></rect><text x="250" y="30" text-anchor="middle" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="18" font-weight="bold">Improvised Litter Construction</text><line x1="80" y1="100" x2="420" y2="100" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="4"></line><line x1="80" y1="280" x2="420" y2="280" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="4"></line><text x="50" y="105" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="10">Pole 1</text><text x="430" y="105" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="10">Pole 2</text><line x1="80" y1="100" x2="80" y2="300" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="2"></line><line x1="420" y1="100" x2="420" y2="300" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="2"></line><rect x="100" y="140" width="300" height="120" fill="#4a7c59" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="1"></rect><text x="250" y="190" text-anchor="middle" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="12">Woven Cloth or Branches</text><text x="250" y="210" text-anchor="middle" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="11">(stretcher bed)</text><line x1="90" y1="320" x2="200" y2="320" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2"></line><text x="145" y="340" text-anchor="middle" fill="#f5f0e8" font-size="10">Handles (4 total)</text><line x1="300" y1="320" x2="410" y2="320" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2"></line><text x="250" y="370" text-anchor="middle" fill="#d4a574" font-size="11">Dimensions: 2 poles (8+ feet), width 18-24 inches</text></svg><h3>Litter Components</h3><ul><li><strong>Two parallel poles:</strong> 8-12 feet long, 4-6 inches diameter (saplings work), strong enough to support weight</li><li><strong>Cross braces:</strong> Secure poles at proper distance with lashing at intervals</li><li><strong>Bed material:</strong> Woven branches, cloth strips, rope sling, improvised webbing - create comfortable, weight-supporting surface</li><li><strong>Handles:</strong> Rope or wood projecting from poles for carriers to grip</li></ul><h3>Construction Steps</h3><ol><li>Select straight poles, peel bark if available (prevents splinters)</li><li>Lash parallel poles at both ends (1-2 feet from ends) with rope or cordage</li><li>Add cross braces every 2-3 feet along poles</li><li>Weave branches or cloth across braces to create bed</li><li>Secure loose material with rope (prevent shifting)</li><li>Test litter by placing heavy object (sandbag) and checking stability</li><li>Add padding (leaves, cloth) under casualty</li></ol><h3>Carrying Litter</h3><p>Four carriers optimal: one at each pole end. Maintain even height - synchronized steps prevent jostling. Switch carriers every 15-20 minutes (prevents fatigue). In steep terrain, six carriers better (two pairs along sides for balance). Secure casualty to litter with rope (prevents falling during extraction).</p></section><section id="helicopter"><h2>Helicopter Operations</h2><p>Helicopter rescue efficient but requires specialized training and coordination.</p><h3>Helicopter Approach</h3><p>Never approach helicopter with rotor running - rotor blade impact fatal. Wait for signal from crew. Approach from side or rear (away from tail rotor). Duck low (unnecessary since rotors high, but instinctive). Follow crew instructions explicitly.</p><h3>Ground-to-Helicopter Communication</h3><p>Position downwind of landing zone. Mark landing zone with bright colors or ground-to-air signals. Clear landing zone of debris (blown by rotor downwash). Secure loose items (flying debris injures people). Helicopter crew will signal when ready for litter/patient loading.</p><h3>Patient Hoisting</h3><p>If landing not possible, helicopter hoists patient. Secure patient in basket or litter with rope. Patient in horizontal or semi-seated position depending on injuries. Hoist slowly upward. Rescuer rides up with patient if possible to monitor. Separate rescue hoist removes rescuer after patient safety secured.</p><h3>Aircraft Safety</h3><p>Main rotor clearance 30+ feet. Tail rotor clearance 5-10 feet (much more dangerous - blade rotation blurs vision). Never move toward aircraft if unsure of clearance. Rotor noise prevents hearing warnings - watch crew hand signals. Static electricity can build up - let crew ground aircraft before touching equipment.</p><h3>Night Helicopter Operations</h3><p>Incredibly dangerous. Rely on crew experience and training. Ground teams light landing zone (flashlights pointing up acceptable, don't shine at helicopter). Avoid sudden movements (rotors are invisible at night - crew operates by instruments). Follow all crew directions exactly.</p></section><section id="lost"><h2>Lost Person Behavior</h2><p>Understanding behavior patterns helps search teams predict victim location.</p><h3>Children (Under 12)</h3><p>Tend to remain close to initial location (typically within 1/4 mile). Hide from searchers (fear of strangers). More active during day, rest at night. Follow water and light. Can be confused/disoriented despite small distances from home. Search thoroughly around home first before expanding search area.</p><h3>Elderly/Dementia</h3><p>Wandering without clear direction. Tend toward familiar routes from memory. Can become disoriented quickly. Don't follow marked trails - take arbitrary directions. May try to return "home" (childhood home, not current residence). Less responsive to calls. Higher mortality rate due to falls, exposure.</p><h3>Athletes/Adventurers</h3><p>Continue in direction they were heading despite problem (injury, lost). Tend to fight situation - exert themselves further (accelerates injury/exhaustion). May be confident they can self-rescue despite serious injury. Search far from initial point (multiple miles). Check challenging terrain (where adventurers attempt to go).</p><h3>Panicked Persons</h3><p>Make poor decisions, sometimes dangerous ones. May run away from rescuers (mistaken for threat). Climb high (attempting to see surroundings). May ignore advice/warnings. Patient, non-threatening approach essential. Announce presence clearly before approaching.</p><h3>Injured Persons</h3><p>Remain in place if serious injury. May be unconscious/non-responsive. Can be protected from elements (under trees, in caves). Search systematically - injured people don't travel. Check all shelter possibilities along victim's path.</p><h3>Behavior Prediction Factors</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Factor</th><th scope="row">Likely Behavior</th><th scope="row">Search Implication</th></tr><tr><td>Young child</td><td>Stays near home</td><td>Search thoroughly nearby</td></tr><tr><td>Elderly lost</td><td>Wanders systematically</td><td>Follow familiar routes</td></tr><tr><td>Night lost</td><td>Stops moving, shelters</td><td>Search next morning nearby</td></tr><tr><td>Injury present</td><td>Stops moving</td><td>Search thoroughly small area</td></tr><tr><td>Panic state</td><td>Runs randomly</td><td>Expand search area</td></tr></table></section><section><h2>Search and Rescue Summary</h2><p>Effective SAR combines systematic search patterns, proper victim assessment, safe extraction techniques, and understanding of victim behavior. Success depends on coordinated team effort, proper training, and rapid response. Professional SAR teams utilize all these techniques - untrained individuals should follow professional guidance and not attempt complex rescues.</p></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="sur-04-navigation-mapping.html">Navigation and Mapping (locating victims)</a> | <a href="sur-03-herbal-medicine.html">Herbal Medicine (victim care)</a> | <a href="sur-05-sanitation-hygiene.html">Sanitation (preventing infection)</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
