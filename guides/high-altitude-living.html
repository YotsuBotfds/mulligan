Your body requires 1-3 weeks to acclimatize to a new elevation as it increases red blood cell production and makes circulatory adjustments.</p><p><strong>Altitude Zones:</strong> Moderate altitude (2,500-3,500m) presents manageable challenges with proper acclimatization. High altitude (3,500-5,500m) requires careful management and more time to adapt. Extreme altitude (above 5,500m) carries serious physiological risks even for acclimatized individuals.</p><p>Acclimatization cannot be rushed. Ascending too quickly leads to altitude sickness and potentially life-threatening conditions. Allow your body time to adapt.</p></section><section id=mountain-sickness><h2>Acute Mountain Sickness</h2><p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Headache, nausea, fatigue, and difficulty sleeping are typical early signs of altitude sickness. These develop 12-24 hours after ascent.</p><p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Limit ascent to 300-500 meters per day above 2,500m. Include rest days (non-ascending days) in your schedule. Hydrate continuously and avoid alcohol. Sleep at lower elevation when possible (climb high, sleep low).</p><p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Stop ascending if symptoms appear. Symptoms often resolve within 24-48 hours at the same elevation. Descend if symptoms worsen or fail to improve.</p><p><strong>Danger Signs:</strong> HACE (High Altitude Cerebral Edema) and HAPE (High Altitude Pulmonary Edema) are life-threatening conditions. Symptoms include severe headache unresponsive to medication, confusion, loss of coordination, or difficulty breathing at rest. Immediate descent is mandatory if these develop.</p></section><section id=high-altitude-agriculture><h2>High-Altitude Agriculture</h2><p><strong>Shorter Growing Season:</strong> At altitude, the frost-free period shrinks dramatically. Plan for 60-100 day growing seasons in many locations. Plant early-maturing varieties exclusively.</p><p><strong>Intense UV Radiation:</strong> UV increases 10-12% per 1,000 meters of elevation. Plants and humans require UV protection. Use shade cloth judiciously—plants still need sufficient light.</p><p><strong>Adapted Crops:</strong> Potatoes (originated in Andes, altitude-adapted), quinoa (complete protein, altitude-tolerant), barley (hardy grain), and other cold-tolerant species. Avoid heat-loving crops like corn and peppers unless in protected microclimates.</p><p><strong>Season Extension:</strong> Stone terraces and walls create warmer microclimates. Row covers and greenhouse structures extend growing season. Thick mulch moderates soil temperature.</p><p><strong>Soil Building and Irrigation:</strong> High-altitude soils are often thin. Build organic matter with compost and crop rotation. Gravity-fed irrigation from snowmelt provides reliable water through growing season.</p></section><section id=mountain-construction><h2>Mountain Construction</h2><p><strong>Cut-Into-Slope Foundations:</strong> Rather than building on surface, excavate into mountainside. This reduces wind exposure, improves insulation, and creates more stable foundations.</p><p><strong>Wind Resistance:</strong> Mountains mean high winds. Design structures with low profiles and steep roofs to shed wind load. Avoid tall chimneys and protrusions.</p><p><strong>Thick Insulation:</strong> High-altitude climates demand superior insulation. Double or triple insulation in walls and ceilings. Minimize window area. Focus on heat retention.</p><p><strong>Efficient Heating:</strong> Kang systems (sleeping platform heated from below by stove exhaust) or hypocaust-style heating maximize efficiency. Traditional mountain communities developed these heating methods through centuries of experience.</p><p><strong>Lightning Protection:</strong> Mountain peaks attract lightning. Install grounding systems on all structures. Metal roofs conduct lightning safely to ground. Never be outdoors in storms.</p></section><section id=daily-life-altitude><h2>Daily Life at Altitude</h2><p><strong>Cooking:</strong> Water boils at lower temperatures at altitude. Boiling point drops roughly 1°C per 300m elevation gain. Pressure cookers become essential for efficient cooking at high elevation.</p><p><strong>UV Protection:</strong> The 10-12% increase per 1,000m elevation dramatically increases sunburn risk. Sunscreen rated 50+ SPF is mandatory. Clothing and hats become essential, not optional.</p><p><strong>Hydration:</strong> Altitude increases fluid loss through respiration and increased urination. Drink 3-4 liters daily minimum, more during activity. Dehydration impairs acclimatization and worsens altitude sickness symptoms.</p><p>Night sleep disruption is common at altitude due to periodic breathing patterns. This typically resolves after 2-3 weeks as acclimatization completes. Maintain regular sleep schedule regardless of disruption.</p></section><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium &mdash; Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
