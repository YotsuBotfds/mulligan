Yield strength at operating temperature critical.</p><h3>Suitable Materials</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Material<th scope="row">Yield Strength<th scope="row">Temperature Limit<th scope="row">Corrosion Resistance<th scope="row">Cost<tr><td>Carbon Steel<td>35,000 psi<td>500°C<td>Poor (rust)<td>Low<tr><td>Mild Steel (low C)<td>30,000 psi<td>400°C<td>Poor<td>Very Low<tr><td>High-Carbon Steel<td>60,000+ psi<td>450°C<td>Poor<td>Medium<tr><td>Stainless Steel (316)<td>25,000 psi @ 500°C<td>800°C<td>Excellent<td>High<tr><td>Cast Iron<td>20,000 psi<td>400°C<td>Fair<td>Low<tr><td>Copper/Brass<td>15,000 psi<td>200°C<td>Excellent<td>Medium<tr><td>Aluminum<td>15,000-40,000 psi<td>250°C<td>Good<td>Low-Medium</table><p><strong>Steam boilers:</strong> Low-carbon (mild) steel traditional choice - inexpensive, adequate strength if proper thickness. High-carbon steel better (stronger, less thickness needed) but more difficult to work. Stainless steel preferred for longevity (no rust) but expensive.</p><p><strong>Pressure rating vs. temperature:</strong> Material yield strength decreases at higher temperature. Carbon steel loses ~10% strength per 50°C above 200°C. Account for operating temperature when calculating wall thickness.</p></section><section id="stress"><h2>Stress Analysis</h2><h3>Thin-Walled Vessel Formula</h3><p>Valid when t/r <0.1 (wall thickness < 10% of radius):</p><p><strong>Hoop stress:</strong> σ_h = PR/t = PD/(2t)</p><p><strong>Longitudinal stress:</strong> σ_l = PR/(2t) = PD/(4t)</p><p><strong>Radial stress:</strong> σ_r ≈ 0 (approximation for thin walls)</p><p><strong>Maximum stress:</strong> Hoop stress governs (2x longitudinal). Vessel fails when hoop stress reaches material yield.</p><h3>Thick-Walled Vessel Formula</h3><p>When t/r ≥ 0.1, Lamé equations apply. More complex but necessary for small-diameter high-pressure vessels. Maximum stress (at inner wall):</p><p>σ_max = P[(r_o/r_i)² + 1] / [(r_o/r_i)² - 1], where r_o = outer radius, r_i = inner radius.</p><h3>Example Calculation</h3><p>10 psi steam boiler, 12-inch outer diameter, carbon steel (35,000 psi yield strength). Desired safety factor = 4.</p><p>Required maximum stress = 35,000 psi / 4 = 8,750 psi.</p><p>Using hoop stress formula: 8,750 = (10 × 12) / (2 × t)</p><p>Solving: t = (10 × 12) / (2 × 8,750) = 0.007 inches minimum.</p><p>Practical minimum: 1/8 inch (0.125 in) wall for safety margin. Larger diameter or higher pressure requires thicker wall or stronger material.</p></section><section id="safety-factors"><h2>Safety Factors</h2><p>Safety factor = yield strength / maximum stress in vessel. Pressure vessels require high safety factors (not like static structures that can tolerate lower factors).</p><h3>Typical Safety Factors</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Application<th scope="row">Safety Factor<th scope="row">Reason<tr><td>Low pressure (<50 psi)<td>3-4<td>Low risk of rupture, material performance well-known<tr><td>Medium pressure (50-500 psi)<td>4-5<td>Higher risk, operational variables<tr><td>High pressure (>500 psi)<td>5-8<td>Very high risk, extreme forces<tr><td>Steam boilers<td>5-8<td>High temperature, corrosion, wear over time<tr><td>Transportation (gas cylinders)<td>10-12<td>Extreme safety - occupant risk</table><p><strong>Derivation:</strong> Safety factor accounts for: (1) material variation (actual strength ±10-20% from nominal), (2) defects (welding flaws, corrosion pits concentrate stress), (3) fatigue (cycling reduces strength), (4) temperature effects (strength decreases at elevated temperature), (5) overload conditions (occasional pressure spikes).</p><p>Conservative approach: always use SF ≥ 4 minimum for any homemade pressure vessel. Higher is better for safety-critical applications.</p></section><section id="construction"><h2>Construction Methods</h2><h3>Rolled Cylinder</h3><p><strong>Process:</strong> Flat steel plate rolled into cylindrical shape, overlapping edges. Join by: (1) forge welding (heat to bright cherry-red, hammer overlap), (2) brazing (copper-based solder), (3) riveting (overlapped rivets, traditional), (4) modern welding (electric arc).</p><p><strong>Welding strength:</strong> Good weld = material strength. Poor weld (incomplete penetration, porosity, cracks) = weak point. Weld should be stress-relieved (heated to 600-700°C then slow-cooled) to reduce internal stress.</p><h3>Welded Hemispherical Ends</h3><p>Cylindrical body with hemispherical ends (half-sphere shape) distributes stress evenly. Construct by: (1) spinning (forming under rotational pressure), (2) welding two shallow dome-shaped pieces, (3) casting (complex, not practical for small-scale). Hemispheres about 40% stronger than flat ends, allowing lower wall thickness for same pressure.</p><h3>Riveted Construction (Traditional)</h3><p>Overlapped plates riveted together (steel or copper rivets). Triple-overlapped (three layers) provides strength. Rivet pattern: ~2-3 inches spacing, offset rows. Disadvantage: slow labor-intensive; advantage: if one rivet fails, others retain integrity (graceful degradation).</p></section><section id="testing"><h2>Pressure Testing</h2><p>Completed vessel must be tested before use to verify integrity and proper wall thickness.</p><h3>Hydrostatic Test</h3><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Fill vessel completely with water (incompressible - safe if failure occurs), pressure to 1.5× operating pressure using hand pump or machine, hold 10 minutes, inspect for leaks. If no leaks, pass.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> 10 psi operating vessel tested at 15 psi. Pressure held using pump with gauge. Any weeping (slow leak) indicates defect. Burst during test means catastrophic failure - indicates design/material problem.</p><h3>Visual Inspection</h3><p>After test, inspect interior/exterior: (1) deposits/corrosion products (color changes indicate corrosion), (2) cracks (usually visible as lines in paint/rust), (3) bulging (plastic deformation indicates overstress). Smooth surfaces indicate good condition. Deep pitting requires vessel retirement.</p><h3>NDT Testing (If Possible)</h3><p>Non-destructive testing: (1) magnetic particle inspection (powder attracted to defects), (2) ultrasonic testing (sound waves detect internal flaws), (3) radiography (X-rays reveal voids/inclusions). These methods detect defects that visual/hydrostatic test might miss. Practical for survival scenario: basic hydrostatic test sufficient; NDT useful if equipment/expertise available.</p></section><section id="boiler"><h2>Steam Boiler Design</h2><p>Steam boilers are pressure vessels heated to generate steam for power/heating. Special considerations: (1) high temperature (100-200°C), (2) cycling (heating/cooling stresses), (3) corrosion (water chemistry critical).</p><h3>Typical Design</h3><p><strong>Type:</strong> Horizontal cylindrical shell with furnace below. Fire tube boiler: hot gases pass through tubes inside water chamber (simple, compact). Water tube boiler: water inside tubes, hot gases surround (safer - small diameter tubes less likely to rupture catastrophically, but more complex).</p><p><strong>Components:</strong> (1) boiler shell (pressure vessel, carbon steel), (2) fire tubes (if fire tube design) or water tubes (if water tube), (3) furnace (fire chamber, refractory-lined), (4) firebox grates, (5) flue (exhaust pathway), (6) feedwater inlet, (7) steam outlet, (8) blowdown valve (drain), (9) safety valve (relief), (10) gauge glass (water level indicator), (11) manhole (access for inspection).</p><h3>Sizing Example</h3><p>Small boiler: 10 psi, 2 ft diameter, 4 ft long. Carbon steel, SF = 5.</p><p>Hoop stress: σ = (10 × 24) / (2 × t) → allowable = 35,000 / 5 = 7,000 psi. Solving: t = 240 / 14,000 = 0.017 inches. Practical thickness: 1/8 inch steel plate (~10 gauge) provides extra margin.</p><p>Steel volume: 2π × r × t × L = 2π × 12 × 0.125 × 48 ≈ 450 cubic inches ≈ 60 pounds of steel (small boiler).</p></section><section id="valves"><h2>Safety Valves and Relief Systems</h2><p>Pressure relief critical - prevents overpressure that could rupture vessel.</p><h3>Safety Valve Design (Spring-Loaded)</h3><p>Valve disk rests on seat, spring maintains closure. When pressure exceeds setpoint, upward force overcomes spring, disk lifts, gas/steam vents. Spring tension adjusted to desired relief pressure.</p><p><strong>Calculation:</strong> Relief pressure = Spring force / disk area. If disk 1 square inch, spring provides 500 pounds force → relief at 500 psi. Adjustment: tighten spring (increases relief pressure), loosen (decreases). Test relief: pump pressure until valve opens, read gauge.</p><h3>Multiple Relief Valves</h3><p>For large vessels, multiple relief valves provide redundancy. If one sticks closed, others protect. Typical: two valves, one set 5% above normal operating pressure, second set 10% above. During normal operation, main valve carries load; if it fails, secondary provides protection.</p><h3>Blowdown and Drains</h3><p>Bottom of boiler accumulates sediment/sludge (minerals from water, corrosion products). Periodically open blowdown valve to drain dirty water/sediment. Prevents accumulation that reduces heat transfer, promotes corrosion.</p><h3>Gauge Glass (Water Level)</h3><p>Essential for boiler safety. Operator must see water level to prevent: (1) boiler dry-out (water below minimum → furnace overheats, boiler fails), (2) overflow (water above maximum → steam quality poor, water carries to turbine). Glass tube with isolation valves at top/bottom allows replacement if broken without losing entire boiler pressure.</p></section><section id="inspection"><h2>Inspection and Maintenance</h2><h3>Routine Inspection</h3><p>Monthly: (1) check for leaks (water seeping indicates wall perforation), (2) listen for unusual sounds (hissing = leak, rumbling = scale/deposit), (3) operate safety valve (pump pressure until relief opens - ensures valve functional), (4) check water level/fill if low (indicates leak or steam loss).</p><p>Quarterly: (1) open drain valve, let dirty water flow 30 seconds (removes accumulated sediment), (2) inspect exterior for corrosion (white powdery deposits = corrosion, deep pitting = wall thickness loss), (3) check gauge glass (is water level visible? test ball-cock float).</p><h3>Long-Term Maintenance</h3><p>Annually: (1) internal inspection if accessible (remove manhole cover, inspect interior for pitting/deposits - requires shutting down, cooling, draining), (2) water chemistry testing (hardness, pH, dissolved oxygen - high oxygen causes corrosion), (3) chemical treatment if water hard (add polyphosphate/softener to prevent scale buildup).</p><h3>Inspection for Corrosion</h3><p>Interior corrosion: uniform brown rust = slow corrosion, acceptable if thickness still adequate. Deep pitting (holes >1/8 inch deep) indicates accelerated corrosion - vessel retirement time. Exterior corrosion: less critical but leads to wall thinning eventually. Paint/coat exterior to prevent.</p><h3>Hydrostatic Retest</h3><p>Periodically (every 3-5 years for commercial boilers, less critical for survival-scenario small boilers), repeat hydrostatic test at 1.5× operating pressure. If passes, confidence in continued safe operation. If fails (leaks), vessel retired or major repair attempted.</p><div class="warning"><strong>CRITICAL SAFETY:</strong> Pressure vessels are potentially lethal devices. Failure results in violent explosion, shrapnel, steam burns. Never assume vessel safe without testing. Always operate with safety valve in place and functional. Boiler explosions historically were major industrial disaster - properly designed/maintained boilers are safe; neglected boilers kill people. Treat pressure vessels with extreme respect - they demand maintenance attention and cannot be left unattended during operation. In post-collapse scenario, boiler skills save lives (steam power for pumping water, heating, cooking) but careless boiler operation kills. Prioritize safety.</div></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="steam-power.html">Steam Power Systems</a> | <a href="metallurgy-basics.html">Metallurgy Fundamentals</a> | <a href="welding-fabrication.html">Welding & Fabrication</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
