Incoming radio waves induce tiny current in antenna coil. Tuning capacitor selects frequency (resonance condition when 1/(2πfC) = Xl, where Xl = 2πfL). Diode (crystal detector) rectifies small AC signal, extracting modulation (audio information). Audio signal small (~microvolts) but sufficient for headphones (which have high impedance, draw minimal current).</p><h3>Construction Materials</h3><p>Coil: 50-200 turns wire wound on cardboard or PVC pipe (2-4 inches diameter). Tuning capacitor: variable capacitor 10-500 pF (can be improvised from parallel plates with variable spacing). Diode: germanium crystal or modern germanium diode 1N34A (silicon less sensitive at microvolts). Earphone: high-impedance telephone earpiece or crystal earphone (1000+ Ω).</p><h3>Tuning & Matching</h3><p>AM band (540-1700 kHz): requires larger capacitance and fewer coil turns. FM band (88-108 MHz): smaller capacitor, fewer turns, more demanding construction. Impedance matching between antenna and coil improves signal transfer. Antenna wire length: 1/4 wavelength optimal, but any long wire works (higher impedance). Ground connection important for return path current.</p><h3>Sensitivity & Range</h3><p>Sensitivity depends on: antenna length and height, tuning capacitor Q factor, crystal diode quality, and antenna location. Local AM stations 1-10 miles typical range (stronger signal = louder audio). FM crystal radios difficult due to higher frequency and lower antenna efficiency. Modern diode 1N34A performs 10× better than natural galena crystals, improving range significantly.</p></section><section id=diodes><h2>Diode Construction & Function</h2><h3>PN Junction Formation</h3><p>P-type semiconductor (gallium or silicon): acceptor atoms create "holes" (missing electrons, act as positive charges). N-type: donor atoms provide free electrons. Junction: abrupt boundary between P and N creates depletion region. Electrons diffuse from N to P, holes from P to N, leaving behind charged donor/acceptor ions. This charge imbalance creates built-in electric field opposing further diffusion.</p><h3>Forward vs Reverse Bias</h3><p><strong>Forward bias:</strong> Positive voltage applied to P side, negative to N side. External field opposes built-in field, reducing depletion width. At threshold voltage (0.7V for silicon, 0.3V for germanium), external field equals built-in field and current flows exponentially (I = Is[e^(qV/kT) - 1]).</p><p><strong>Reverse bias:</strong> Negative voltage on P side. Depletion width increases, strengthens built-in field, blocks current flow. Small reverse leakage current (nanoamps) flows due to minority carriers and thermal generation. At breakdown voltage (varies 50-1000V depending on doping), reverse current suddenly increases (Zener effect or impact ionization).</p><h3>Diode Types & Characteristics</h3><p><strong>Rectifier diode (1N4007):</strong> General-purpose rectification. 1000V PIV (peak inverse voltage), 1A forward current. Slow recovery (~1 µs) acceptable for 60 Hz AC.</p><p><strong>Fast-recovery diode (1N4148):</strong> Used in high-frequency circuits. <4 ns recovery, can switch at MHz frequencies. Lower voltage rating (100V typical).</p><p><strong>Zener diode:</strong> Designed to conduct in reverse at specific breakdown voltage (3.3-200V available). Regulation in voltage regulators and protection circuits.</p><p><strong>Schottky diode:</strong> Metal-semiconductor junction, very low forward voltage (0.2-0.3V vs 0.7V silicon). Fast recovery, used in power supplies and RF circuits.</p></section><section id=transistor-basics><h2>Transistor Fundamentals</h2><h3>BJT vs FET Comparison</h3><p><strong>Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT):</strong> Two junctions (NPN or PNP). Small base current controls large collector current. Gain (β) typically 50-300. Lower input impedance (kΩ range), high output impedance. Lower cost, simpler circuits, lower noise. Used in low-frequency analog and small-signal applications.</p><p><strong>Field-Effect Transistor (FET):</strong> Voltage-controlled device. Gate voltage controls resistance of channel. Very high input impedance (MΩ-GΩ), lower output impedance than BJT. Lower gain (transconductance 1-100 mS). Less noise, better for high-impedance circuits. MOSFET type most common now.</p><h3>BJT Biasing & Operating Points</h3><p>Base-emitter voltage: VBE = 0.7V (silicon), 0.3V (germanium). Collector current: IC = β × IB where β is current gain (hFE). Saturation: collector voltage approaches emitter voltage, transistor "on" fully. Cutoff: no base current, no collector current, transistor "off". Active region: between saturation and cutoff, suitable for amplification.</p><h3>Transistor Maximum Ratings</h3><p>Collector-emitter voltage (VCES): maximum voltage without breakdown. Collector current (IC): maximum steady-state current (exceeding causes heat damage). Power dissipation (PD): maximum heat generation. Thermal runaway: as temperature increases, leakage current increases, generating more heat, until transistor fails catastrophically. Proper heat sinking critical for power transistors.</p></section><section id=bjt><h2>Bipolar Junction Transistors</h2><h3>NPN Transistor Operation</h3><p>NPN has electron flow from N-type collector through P-type base to N-type emitter. Small base current causes large collector current (emitter current = base + collector current). Common configurations: common-emitter (high gain, inverted output), common-base (high impedance, low noise), common-collector (high input impedance, unity gain buffer).</p><h3>PNP Transistor Operation</h3><p>Opposite polarity: hole flow from P-type collector through N-type base to P-type emitter. Voltage polarities reversed compared to NPN (negative collector, positive base). Slower than NPN due to lower hole mobility. Used in complementary pairs (push-pull output stages) where NPN sources current and PNP sinks current.</p><h3>Common Emitter Amplifier</h3><p>High gain (50-300×), inverted output. Input signal applied to base through coupling capacitor, emitter grounded or bypassed with capacitor for AC gain. Collector load resistor determines voltage gain and output impedance. Emitter resistance Re reduces gain (negative feedback) but improves stability. Typical gain Av = -Rc/Re where Rc is collector resistor, Re is emitter resistor.</p><h3>Biasing Methods</h3><p><strong>Fixed bias:</strong> Constant base resistor from supply. Simple but unstable with temperature (transistor gains vary ±50% over temperature).</p><p><strong>Voltage divider bias (self-bias):</strong> Base voltage set by resistor divider independent of transistor characteristics. Stable, insensitive to transistor variations. Used in most designs.</p><p><strong>Emitter bias:</strong> Emitter resistor carries collector current, maintaining base-emitter voltage stable through feedback. Very stable, excellent biasing method.</p></section><section id=amplifiers><h2>Simple Amplifier Circuits</h2><h3>Common-Collector Amplifier (Emitter Follower)</h3><p>High input impedance (MΩ typical), low output impedance (Ω range), unity voltage gain but high current gain. Output voltage "follows" input (inverted relative to CE, but same polarity as CC). Used as impedance converter: high-impedance source can drive low-impedance load. Base carries small current; emitter supplies load current.</p><h3>Darlington Pair</h3><p>Two transistors in cascade: first provides high impedance input and current gain β₁, second amplifies that current gain β₂. Total gain = β₁ × β₂ (10,000-100,000). Extremely high input impedance and current gain. Trade-off: VBE ≈ 1.4V (two base-emitter drops), slower frequency response, lower maximum frequency.</p><h3>Push-Pull Output Stage</h3><p>Complementary pair: NPN transistor sources current (pulls output toward supply), PNP sinks current (pulls toward ground). Eliminates output impedance because current always flows from one transistor. Used in power amplifiers driving speakers (8Ω impedance). Requires biasing to avoid cross-over distortion where output hangs momentarily as current transfers between transistors.</p><h3>Differential Amplifier</h3><p>Two transistors with shared emitter resistor. Output = gm × (V1 - V2) where gm is transconductance. Acts as subtractor: amplifies difference between two inputs while rejecting common-mode signal. Foundation of operational amplifiers. Excellent noise rejection and stability.</p></section><section id=logic-gates><h2>Simple Logic Gates</h2><h3>Transistor Inverter (NOT Gate)</h3><p>Single transistor with resistor load. Input high → transistor saturated → output low. Input low → transistor cutoff → output high. Implements logic inversion. Adding more input transistors in parallel → NAND gate (all must be low for output high). Adding transistors in series → NOR gate.</p><h3>NAND Gate</h3><p>Multiple transistors in series from output to ground. All inputs must be high to saturate transistors and pull output low. Any input low → transistor cutoff → output high. Universal gate: can construct AND, OR, NOT from NAND gates alone.</p><h3>NOR Gate</h3><p>Multiple transistors in parallel from output to ground. Any input high saturates a transistor, pulling output low. All inputs low → all transistors cutoff → output high. Equally universal as NAND (can implement any logic function).</p><h3>Fan-Out & Loading</h3><p>Single transistor output can drive only limited number of gate inputs (fan-out). Typical fan-out 10: one transistor can drive 10 standard logic inputs. Exceeding fan-out causes output voltage to degrade (high output sags toward ground). Buffer gate increases fan-out or drives heavy loads.</p></section><section id=component-salvage><h2>Component Salvage & Testing</h2><h3>Safe Desoldering Techniques</h3><p>Solder sucker: mechanical vacuum pump removes molten solder from joint. Solder wick: braided copper absorbs solder through capillary action. Hot air tool: heats entire component and surroundings simultaneously, avoiding localized heating that cracks solder joint on multi-pin components. Heat gun on lowest setting works in pinch but risks component damage.</p><h3>Component Testing with Multimeter</h3><p><strong>Diode test:</strong> Multimeter diode setting applies small voltage, measures forward voltage drop (0.6-0.7V forward, open circuit reverse). Reverse readings indicate shorts or bad diodes.</p><p><strong>Transistor test:</strong> Transistor setting tests base-emitter and base-collector junctions. Can verify NPN vs PNP and rough transistor condition. Does not measure gain (hFE) or high-frequency characteristics—analog meter does, digital meter provides hFE test on some models.</p><p><strong>Resistance check:</strong> Ohm mode on resistors up to 100 MΩ. Higher resistance (leakage) indicates possible failure.</p><h3>Testing High-Voltage Components</h3><p>Capacitors: capacitance meter shows μF/nF rating. Resistance: should be very high (>MΩ) unless specifically low-ESR type. Leakage current: electrolytic capacitors typically <1 µA per µF per volt rated voltage. Exceeding indicates failure.</p><p>Transistor power: P = VCE × IC. A transistor with 10V collector-emitter and 1A collector current dissipates 10W. Requires adequate heat sinking; without heatsink, package overheats and fails within seconds at high power.</p></section><section id=rectifier><h2>Rectifier Circuits</h2><h3>Half-Wave Rectification</h3><p>Single diode conducts on positive AC half-cycle. Output is pulsating DC with 50% ripple voltage. Frequency of output pulses = input AC frequency (60 Hz becomes 60 Hz ripple = 16.7 ms period). Average voltage = 0.318 × peak AC voltage. RMS voltage = 0.5 × peak AC voltage. Asymmetric load on transformer (half AC cycle flowing through primary, saturating core).</p><h3>Full-Wave Rectification</h3><p>Center-tap transformer or bridge circuit. Both half-cycles conduct (output frequency = 2× input = 120 Hz for 60 Hz input = 8.3 ms period). Average voltage = 0.636 × peak AC voltage. Ripple frequency doubled vs half-wave, easier filtering. Symmetric transformer loading. Bridge rectifier: four diodes, no center tap needed.</p><h3>Ripple Voltage & Filtering</h3><p>Unfiltered rectifier output ripple voltage (peak-to-peak) depends on diode conduction angle and load current. With capacitive filter: ripple = I × Tperiod / C = I / (2fC) where f is ripple frequency. A 10A load, full-wave rectifier (f = 120 Hz), 1000 µF capacitor: ripple = 10 / (2 × 120 × 0.001) = 41.7V peak-to-peak (unacceptable). Double capacitor to 2000 µF reduces ripple to 20.8V.</p></section><section id=power-semiconductors><h2>Power Semiconductors</h2><h3>Power Diodes</h3><p>High-current rectifiers rated 10-1000A. Heat dissipation critical; mounted on large heatsinks. Thermal resistance from junction to heatsink determines temperature rise: ΔT = P × Rth where P is dissipated power. Example: 100W power dissipation, 0.5°C/W thermal resistance = 50°C rise above heatsink temperature. Undersizing heatsink causes instant failure.</p><h3>Power Transistors</h3><p>BJT: Large collectors handle 10-100A. MOSFET: Excellent power handling, lower on-state loss (Rds-on = 0.01-0.1Ω), faster switching. IGBT: Combines BJT drive simplicity with MOSFET efficiency. 600V-3300V ratings available. Switching frequency 1-200 kHz depending on type.</p><h3>Thyristors (SCR & Triac)</h3><p><strong>Silicon Controlled Rectifier (SCR):</strong> Four-layer device (PNPN), acts like diode but can be controlled. Gate pulse turns on; once conducting, cannot turn off until current falls below holding current. Used in AC phase control, DC choppers, surge protection.</p><p><strong>Triac:</strong> Bidirectional SCR, conducts both polarities of AC. Gate pulse turns on; conducts until AC passes through zero. Used in light dimmers, AC motor speed control, heating element switching.</p><h3>MOSFET Power Loss Calculation</h3><p>Conduction loss: P = I² × Rds-on (dominant at high current). Switching loss: P = 0.5 × V × I × (trise + tfall) × fsw (dominant at high frequency). Total power = conduction + switching. At low frequency and high current, conduction loss dominates. At high frequency and low current, switching loss dominates.</p></section><div class=warning><strong>Safety Warning:</strong> Semiconductor junctions contain potent source of electrical hazard despite low voltage. Capacitors across rectifier outputs store high voltage even when unplugged—high-voltage power supplies can cause death. Discharge all capacitors by shorting terminals with insulated tool before touching. High-current semiconductor circuits generate extreme heat and can ignite clothing or skin on contact. Respect power dissipation calculations—insufficient heat sinking causes rapid component failure and risk of component explosion (capacitive discharge arc).</strong></div><div class=tip><strong>Testing Tip:</strong> When salvaging components from electronics, test before incorporating into project. A bad transistor in a circuit with high-current power supply can fail catastrophically, damaging surrounding components. Test diodes in both directions; good diodes conduct one direction only. Measure transistor gain (hFE) if multimeter supports it; if gain is zero or extremely low, component is likely bad.</div><div class=related role="navigation" aria-label="Related guides"><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href=electrical-wiring.html>Electrical Wiring</a><a href=electrical-motors.html>Electric Motors</a><a href=power-distribution.html>Power Distribution</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium &mdash; Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
