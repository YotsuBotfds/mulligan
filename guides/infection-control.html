Breaking any link prevents infection. Control measures target each step: eliminate source (vaccination, hygiene, isolation), block transmission (barriers, disinfection, distance), protect susceptible (vaccination, prophylaxis, isolation from exposed).</p><h3>Standard Precautions</h3><p>Apply to all patients, all situations: assume all blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, non-intact skin, and mucous membranes may contain pathogens. Use gloves for contact with blood/body fluids. Use gown/apron if splashing expected. Use mask/eye protection for splashing. Perform hand hygiene frequently. Properly dispose of sharps and contaminated materials.</p><h3>Transmission-Based Precautions</h3><ul><li><strong>Contact:</strong> Direct or indirect contact with infected persons/surfaces. Use gloves, gown. Keep patients in separate areas if possible.<li><strong>Droplet:</strong> Respiratory droplets (within 3-6 feet). Use mask/N95 for cough/sneeze. Keep distance from patient if possible.<li><strong>Airborne:</strong> Aerosolized particles (tuberculosis, measles, chickenpox). Use N95 respirator, PAPR if available. Negative pressure room ideal. Isolation critical.</ul></section><section id="hand-hygiene"><h2>Hand Hygiene</h2><h3>When to Perform Hand Hygiene</h3><ul><li>Before and after patient contact<li>Before eating, drinking, taking medication<li>Before and after handling food<li>After using toilet<li>After contact with blood/body fluids (even with gloves)<li>After removing gloves<li>After touching face/hair/body<li>Before and after preparing/handling medication</ul><h3>Hand Hygiene Technique</h3><p><strong>With soap and water (preferred if visibly soiled):</strong> Wet hands with water, apply soap, rub all surfaces (palms, backs, between fingers, under nails, wrists) for 20+ seconds. Rinse thoroughly. Dry with clean cloth or air-dry. For field expedient: vigorously rub hands with sand or soil (if no water), then rinse with water if available.</p><p><strong>Alcohol-based sanitizer (when soap/water unavailable):</strong> Apply 1/2 teaspoon (3mL), rub all surfaces until dry. Requires 60-95% alcohol to be effective. Less effective on heavily soiled hands.</p><h3>Nail Care</h3><p>Trim fingernails short; bacteria hide under nails. Avoid artificial nails (harbor pathogens). Prevent nail damage which allows bacterial entry. In survival: clean nails with brush and water regularly, use sharp object to remove debris.</p></section><section id="ppe"><h2>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</h2><h3>Gloves</h3><p>Latex, nitrile, or vinyl. Gloves reduce hand contamination 99%; do NOT replace hand hygiene. Change between patients/tasks. Remove properly: grasp outside wrist, peel downward inside-out. Don't touch exterior. Use double gloves for high-risk procedures. In shortage: prioritize gloves for high-risk tasks (blood contact, open wounds). Reuse gloves by sanitizing if absolutely necessary (not ideal, increases infection risk).</p><h3>Masks and Respirators</h3><ul><li><strong>Surgical mask:</strong> Protects others from wearer; minimal self-protection. Effective for droplet precautions (wearer is source).<li><strong>N95 respirator:</strong> Protects wearer from airborne particles; requires fit testing for 95% efficiency. Use for tuberculosis, measles, varicella, COVID-19 (airborne transmission phase).<li><strong>KN95/FFP2:</strong> International equivalents to N95. Slightly lower efficiency (94-95%) but acceptable alternative.</ul><p>Field expedient mask: cloth layers (cotton), tied around nose/mouth. Provides some protection, not equivalent to surgical mask. Protect mask by keeping dry, never touch front surface.</p><h3>Eye and Face Protection</h3><p>For procedures with blood/body fluid splash risk: use goggles or face shield (protects mucous membranes). Remove after use, clean if reusable. In field: glasses provide some protection; improvise shield from clear plastic if needed.</p><h3>Gowns and Aprons</h3><p>Protects clothing/skin from splashing. Change after contact with potentially infectious material. If shortage: use plastic bags, cloth, or available waterproof material. Priority: high-splash procedures (surgery, suction, certain nursing care).</p></section><section id="asepsis"><h2>Aseptic Technique</h2><h3>Clean vs Sterile</h3><p><strong>Clean:</strong> Minimizes microorganisms; acceptable for most patient care, wound dressing, daily living. <strong>Sterile:</strong> Completely free of microorganisms; required for invasive procedures (surgery, catheter insertion, injection). In survival: prioritize sterile technique for invasive procedures, clean technique for routine care.</p><h3>Sterile Field Maintenance</h3><ul><li>Place sterile items on clean, dry surface<li>Keep sterile items above waist level (lower areas easily contaminated)<li>Do NOT reach across sterile field (contaminates)<li>Do NOT touch sterile items with non-sterile hands<li>Only sterile items contact sterile field<li>Sterile field is contaminated if wet, touched by non-sterile object, exposed to air >1 hour</ul><h3>Handling Sterile Items</h3><p>If gloved, ensure gloves are sterile. If changing gloves: remove non-sterile gloves without contaminating hands, perform hand hygiene, don sterile gloves. For handling with bare hands: perform hand hygiene thoroughly, handle by edges/outer surfaces only, avoid touching surfaces that will contact patients.</p><h3>Environmental Asepsis</h3><p>Clean environment minimizes infection: clean spills immediately, dispose of contaminated materials in leak-proof containers, keep work surfaces clean, limit traffic in high-asepsis areas, prevent dust generation during procedures.</p></section><section id="sterilization"><h2>Sterilization and Disinfection</h2><h3>Sterilization Methods</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Method<th scope="row">Mechanism<th scope="row">Time<th scope="row">Effectiveness<th scope="row">Practicality<tr><td>Autoclaving<td>Heat + steam + pressure<td>15-30 min<td>Excellent<td>Requires equipment<tr><td>Boiling<td>Dry heat 100°C<td>20-30 min<td>Good (not sporicide)<td>Simple, field expedient<tr><td>Dry heat oven<td>Hot air 160-180°C<td>45-120 min<td>Excellent<td>Requires oven<tr><td>Chemical gas<td>Ethylene oxide gas<td>Hours (+ aeration)<td>Excellent<td>Toxic, equipment required<tr><td>UV light<td>DNA damage<td>5-10 min<td>Moderate (surface only)<td>Limited penetration</table><h3>Boiling (Field Expedient Sterilization)</h3><p>Bring water to rolling boil, submerge instruments for 20 minutes (sea level; add 10 min per 3,000 ft elevation). Remove with sterile forceps, place on sterile surface to cool/dry. Note: boiling does NOT kill spores (C. difficile, B. anthracis); for most survival scenarios, adequate. Cover pot to prevent recontamination. Multiple boiling cycles acceptable.</p><h3>Disinfection Levels</h3><ul><li><strong>Low:</strong> Removes vegetative bacteria; dilute bleach (1:100), ethanol 70%<li><strong>Intermediate:</strong> Kills most bacteria, viruses, fungi; 70% ethanol, phenol, Lysol<li><strong>High:</strong> Kills everything including spores; glutaraldehyde, peracetic acid, bleach (1:10 dilution)</ul><h3>Household Disinfectants</h3><p>Bleach (sodium hypochlorite 5-6%): 1 part bleach + 9 parts water = 0.5% solution (intermediate disinfection). 1:1 ratio with water = 2.5-3% (high-level disinfection). Use immediately after mixing; potency decreases over hours. Vinegar (acetic acid) has limited disinfection; not reliable alone. Alcohol 70% reasonable if available.</p></section><section id="wound-care"><h2>Wound Care Protocols</h2><h3>Clean Wound Dressing</h3><ol><li>Perform hand hygiene, don gloves<li>Remove old dressing; observe for signs of infection (increased drainage, odor, redness, warmth)<li>Cleanse wound gently with sterile saline or boiled cooled water if contaminated<li>Pat dry with sterile gauze<li>Apply antiseptic ointment if available (bacitracin, chlorhexidine)</li><li>Cover with sterile non-adherent dressing (telfa) or clean cloth<li>Secure with tape or cloth strips<li>Discard contaminated materials in leak-proof container<li>Perform hand hygiene</ol><h3>Infected Wound Management</h3><p>More frequent dressing changes (daily or more). Gentle cleansing to remove exudate without disrupting healing tissue. Consider culture/sensitivity if available (identify organism, antibiotic susceptibility). Systemic antibiotics critical. Elevated temperature on gauze during dressing changes. Monitor for systemic signs (fever, malaise, enlarged lymph nodes). For spreading infection (cellulitis, lymphangitis): treat as medical emergency requiring immediate antibiotics/evacuation.</p><h3>Chronic Wound Prevention</h3><p>Pressure ulcers (decubitus): frequent position changes every 2 hours, padding for bony prominences, moisture management. Diabetic ulcers: strict foot inspection daily (dry, protected, no pressure areas), manage blood glucose. Venous stasis ulcers: elevation, compression if available. Arterial ulcers: keep warm, avoid pressure. Poor circulation = slow healing; optimize nutrition and oxygenation.</p></section><section id="isolation"><h2>Isolation Precautions</h2><h3>Physical Isolation</h3><p>Separate infected patient from non-infected. Private room ideal; if unavailable, place patients >3 feet apart (droplet), or >6 feet apart (airborne preferred, not always possible in survival). Dedicated equipment when possible (stethoscope, blood pressure cuff, thermometer). Do NOT move patient to different locations; minimizes transmission risk.</p><h3>Respiratory Isolation</h3><p>For TB, measles, varicella (before lesions crust over): respiratory protection (N95 or better if available). Surgical mask on patient if cooperative. Limit movement from room. Continue until patient improves (typically 1-2 weeks on antibiotics for TB, >1 week for measles/varicella). Monitor contacts for symptoms.</p><h3>Enteric Isolation</h3><p>For patients with diarrhea from infectious source (bacteria, viruses, parasites): separate bathroom/commode if possible. Hand hygiene after any contact with feces. Gloves for patient care. Do NOT prepare food for others while caring for diarrhea patient. Monitor contacts for symptom development.</p></section><section id="disease-prevention"><h2>Disease Prevention Strategies</h2><h3>Vaccination Program (if Available)</h3><p>Priority in survival settings: measles (highly contagious, preventable), polio, diphtheria/tetanus, meningococcal meningitis (community spread risk). Vaccination during outbreak response can prevent secondary cases. Even with limited vaccine supply, vaccinate contacts of confirmed cases first.</p><h3>Waterborne Disease Prevention</h3><p>Primary source of disease transmission in survival scenarios. Boil water (rolling boil 1 minute, 3+ minutes at altitude). Filtration (cloth, sand, commercial filters) removes particles but not pathogens; combine with boiling. Chemical treatment: chlorine (2-3 drops household bleach per liter, wait 30 min; cloudy water needs 8 drops), iodine tablets (follow package directions, 30 min wait), bleach tablets. Separate drinking water from greywater; never contaminate water supply with feces.</p><h3>Vector Control</h3><p>Mosquitoes (malaria, dengue, yellow fever), ticks (Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), flies (diarrheal disease): remove standing water (breed mosquitoes), use insect repellent (DEET 20-30%), wear long sleeves/pants in high-risk areas, inspect skin daily for ticks, remove ticks carefully (grasp close to skin, pull straight out, don't twist/crush). Keep food covered to prevent fly contamination.</p><h3>Hygiene Promotion</h3><p>Educate community: hand hygiene is single most effective intervention, safe food handling (cook thoroughly, prevent cross-contamination), sanitation (safe waste disposal, separate toilets from water), respiratory etiquette (cover mouth when coughing/sneezing). In survival groups: assign hygiene roles, maintain supplies, monitor compliance.</p></section><section id="safety"><div class="warning"><h3>Critical Infection Control Warnings</h3><ul><li>Needlestick injury = high transmission risk for bloodborne pathogens (HIV, hepatitis B/C). Immediately: wash with soap and water, encourage bleeding, report incident. Post-exposure prophylaxis if available within hours.<li>Biological spill = potential hazard. Contain with absorbent material, disinfect with bleach 1:1 with water, let stand 10+ minutes, then clean.<li>Outbreak recognition = rapidly spreading illness in community. Isolate cases, alert authorities if possible, implement enhanced precautions, monitor contacts.<li>Personal illness = do NOT provide patient care if symptomatic (respiratory, GI, skin infections). Self-isolate to prevent spread to vulnerable patients.</ul></div></section><section id="mistakes"><div class="mistakes"><h3>Common Infection Control Failures</h3><ul><li><strong>Hand hygiene neglect:</strong> Most important measure; inconsistent compliance negates other precautions<li><strong>Cross-contamination:</strong> Touching sterile field, reusing non-sterile items, inadequate hand hygiene between tasks<li><strong>Improper PPE use:</strong> Touching mask/goggles front surface, dangling gloves over clean surface, reusing contaminated PPE without cleaning<li><strong>Inadequate disinfection:</strong> Using ineffective agents, insufficient contact time, not accounting for contamination level<li><strong>Missed exposure risk:</strong> Assuming low-risk activities don't require precautions; all patient contact = potential exposure</ul></div></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="sterilization-methods.html">Sterilization Methods</a> • <a href="medications.html">Essential Medications</a> • <a href="wound-care.html">Wound Management</a> • <a href="infectious-disease.html">Infectious Diseases</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
