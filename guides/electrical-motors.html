Current through the coil creates force perpendicular to both magnetic field and current direction. A commutator (split ring) reverses current as coil rotates, keeping torque unidirectional. The Lorentz force F = I × L × B drives rotation continuously.</p><h3>Components</h3><ul><li><strong>Stator (magnets):</strong> Permanent magnets or electromagnets creating base magnetic field. Radial field configuration most common.</li><li><strong>Armature (rotor):</strong> Laminated iron core with copper wire windings. Rotates on motor shaft.</li><li><strong>Commutator:</strong> Split copper ring on shaft. Has 2, 4, 6, or more segments depending on pole pair count and winding.</li><li><strong>Brushes:</strong> Carbon or copper-graphite contacts that slide on commutator, delivering current to correct windings.</li><li><strong>Shaft & bearings:</strong> Support armature rotation with minimal friction.</li><li><strong>Housing:</strong> Contains magnets and provides structural support.</li></ul><h3>SVG: DC Motor Cross-Section</h3><svg viewbox='0 0 500 420' xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="background:#1a2e1a" aria-label='Electric Motors diagram 1'><defs><lineargradient id="ironGrad" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="100%"><stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#888;stop-opacity:1"></stop><stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#333;stop-opacity:1"></stop></lineargradient></defs><circle cx="250" cy="200" r="180" fill="none" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2"></circle><circle cx="250" cy="200" r="170" fill="url(#ironGrad)" opacity="0.3"></circle><rect x="80" y="140" width="60" height="120" fill="#d4a574" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2"></rect><text x="85" y="235" font-size="13" fill="#f5f0e8" font-weight="bold">N</text><rect x="360" y="140" width="60" height="120" fill="#8b7355" stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2"></rect><text x="375" y="235" font-size="13" fill="#f5f0e8" font-weight="bold">S</text><circle cx="250" cy="200" r="60" fill="none" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="3"></circle><circle cx="250" cy="145" r="15" fill="#8b7355" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="2"></circle><circle cx="250" cy="255" r="15" fill="#8b7355" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="2"></circle><circle cx="250" cy="145" r="8" fill="#d4a574"></circle><circle cx="250" cy="255" r="8" fill="#d4a574"></circle><line x1="220" y1="200" x2="280" y2="200" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="2"></line><line x1="250" y1="170" x2="250" y2="230" stroke="#d4a574" stroke-width="2"></line><path d='M 150 200 Q 200 150 250 145 Q 300 150 350 200' stroke="#b8956a" stroke-width="2" fill="none" stroke-dasharray="5,5"></path><text x="210" y="125" font-size="11" fill="#b8956a">Magnetic Field</text><text x="220" y="410" font-size="12" fill="#d4a574" font-weight="bold">Armature Coil Rotating</text></svg><h3>Commutator & Brushes</h3><p>The commutator switches current direction through armature coil. A 2-pole motor has 2 commutator segments; 4-pole has 4. Brushes must sit at neutral plane (where magnetic flux is weakest) to minimize sparking. Brush pressure is critical: 1-3 oz per brush typical. Too light = poor contact; too heavy = excessive wear.</p><h3>Wire Sizing for DC Motors</h3><p>For motor windings, use formula: Wire diameter (mm) = 0.5 × √(Current in Amps). For example, 20A requires approximately 2.2mm diameter wire. Current density of 3-5 A/mm² is typical for continuous duty. Higher density means more heat; lower gives better cooling and efficiency.</p><h3>Torque & Power Relationships</h3><p>Torque (Nm) = 0.159 × Φ × I × Z / P where Φ is flux, I is current, Z is total conductors, P is poles. Power (W) = Torque (Nm) × RPM / 9.55. Efficiency is output power / input power; continuous-duty motors typically 80-90% efficient.</p></section><section id="ac-motors"><h2>AC Motors: Induction & Synchronous</h2><h3>Induction Motor Principle</h3><p>In induction motor, AC current in stator windings creates rotating magnetic field. This field induces current in rotor (squirrel cage or wound), which creates its own magnetic field that interacts with stator field. Rotor tries to "follow" stator field but always lags (slip) slightly.</p><h3>Stator Winding Configuration</h3><p>3-phase induction motors use three sets of stator windings, each 120 degrees apart. Single-phase motors use split-phase, capacitor-start, or shaded-pole designs to create rotation. Stator has multiple slots (typically 24, 36, 48) with windings distributed across them. Slot pitch = 360° / Number of slots.</p><h3>Rotor Types</h3><p><strong>Squirrel cage:</strong> Aluminum or copper bars welded to rings at each end. Simple, rugged, inexpensive. <strong>Wound rotor:</strong> Multiple windings similar to stator, connected to slip rings. Allows external resistance for soft starting and load control.</p><h3>Speed Formula</h3><p>Synchronous speed = (120 × Frequency) / Pole pairs. At 60 Hz: 2-pole = 3600 RPM, 4-pole = 1800 RPM, 6-pole = 1200 RPM. Actual motor speed is slightly lower due to slip (1-5% for normal loads). Slip = (Sync RPM - Actual RPM) / Sync RPM × 100%.</p><h3>AC Motor Efficiency</h3><p>Efficiency depends on load. Motors are most efficient at 75-100% rated load (typically 85-92% efficient). At 50% load, efficiency drops to 70-80%. Undersizing motors reduces system efficiency; oversizing also wastes energy. Match motor to typical operating load.</p></section><section id="universal-motors"><h2>Universal Motors</h2><h3>Construction & Operation</h3><p>A universal motor has wound stator poles (not permanent magnets), allowing operation on both AC and DC. Rotor is armature with commutator and brushes, identical to DC motors. This hybrid design gives excellent starting torque and speed control. On DC: operates like standard DC motor. On AC: current alternates through both stator and rotor coils in sync, maintaining constant rotation direction.</p><h3>Speed Control</h3><p>Universal motors can be speed-controlled by varying applied voltage. Simple series resistor, rheostat, or PWM circuit works. Power tools often use solid-state speed controllers with 50-20,000 Hz PWM for smooth speed adjustment. Higher PWM frequency reduces audible noise.</p><h3>Brush Maintenance & Replacement</h3><p>Brushes wear constantly due to commutator friction. Check for excessive sparking at high speed. Replace when worn to 1/8 inch stub. Sparking indicates worn brushes, dirty commutator, or misaligned brush holders. Clean commutator with fine sandpaper and degreaser. Brushes must sit at neutral plane for minimum sparking.</p><h3>AC vs DC Performance</h3><p>AC operation at higher frequencies causes voltage drops across inductance, reducing power output compared to DC. Same motor typically rated 10-15% lower power on AC than DC. Heat generation increases on AC due to eddy current losses in iron core.</p></section><section id="stepper-motors"><h2>Stepper Motors</h2><h3>Principle & Types</h3><p>Stepper motors move in discrete angular steps. Applying current to different coil combinations creates precise positioning without feedback. Three common types: variable-reluctance (simplest, no holding torque), permanent-magnet (small, holding torque), and hybrid (best performance, fine steps).</p><h3>Step Sequences</h3><p>Typical NEMA 17 stepper with 200 steps per revolution and half-stepping gives 400 microsteps. Full step: coils energize in sequence (1, 2, 3, 4, 1...). Half step: alternates between single and dual coil energization (1, 1-2, 2, 2-3, 3, 3-4, 4, 4-1, 1...). Microstepping uses PWM to achieve sub-step positioning for smoother motion.</p><h3>Driver Circuits & Current Control</h3><p>Stepper coils require current pulses timed precisely. Simple drivers use discrete transistors with flyback diodes. Better designs use dedicated stepper driver ICs (ULN2003, DRV8825, TB6560). Microstepping drivers use PWM to achieve sub-step positioning. Current limit resistor: R = (V - Coil voltage) / Rated current.</p><h3>Holding Torque & Load Analysis</h3><p>Holding torque (stationary, powered) is typically 30-50% higher than dynamic torque. Maximum speed depends on stepping rate and load inertia. At 1000 steps/sec and 200 steps/rev, motor runs at 300 RPM. Exceeding maximum step rate causes loss of synchronization and stall. Resonance can occur at certain step rates; adjust step rate to avoid.</p></section><section id="winding"><h2>Winding Patterns & Calculations</h2><h3>Lap Winding (DC Motors)</h3><p>Lap windings have multiple parallel paths. Coil ends progress to adjacent commutator bars. For 12-bar commutator with 4 poles, simple lap has 4 parallel paths (poles = paths). Allows high current at lower voltage. Commutator requires one brush pair per pole pair. Number of parallel paths = 2P (P = poles).</p><h3>Wave Winding (DC Motors)</h3><p>Wave windings have two parallel paths regardless of pole count. Coil ends progress many segments ahead. Higher voltage, lower current. Used when high voltage and lower amperage are needed. Two brush pairs are sufficient. Wave winding gives more even commutator wear.</p><h3>Slot & Pole Calculations</h3><p>For distributed winding: Coils per pole = Total slots / (2 × Poles). For 12 slots and 4 poles: 12 / (2 × 4) = 1.5 coils per pole group. Commutator bars = Number of coils = 12 (in this example). Slot opening width determines maximum wire diameter that can fit.</p><h3>Turns Per Coil Calculation</h3><p>Formula: Turns = (V × 10^8) / (Φ × Ω × RPM) where V=voltage, Φ=flux in maxwells, Ω=speed ratio, RPM=motor speed. More turns = higher voltage constant Kv (V/RPM), lower torque constant Kt (Nm/A). Fewer turns = lower voltage, higher current, higher torque.</p><h3>Slot Fill Factor</h3><p>Optimal copper fill is 40-60% of slot area. Too much copper = excessive current, heat; too little = wasted slot space. Wire insulation thickness increases with voltage rating. 24V motor can use thinner insulation than 480V motor in same slot. Fill factor = (Copper area) / (Total slot area).</p></section><section id="rewinding"><h2>Motor Rewinding Procedures</h2><h3>Documentation & Planning</h3><p>Before dismantling, photograph motor from multiple angles. Note wire color sequence, coil positions, commutator bar connections. Count turns on at least two coils to determine total turns per coil group. Measure wire diameter with caliper and record. These records are essential for reassembly. Make sketch of winding pattern.</p><h3>Disassembly Sequence</h3><p>Remove shaft coupling or pulley (mark position). Unbolt end bells and slide out rotor. For brushed motors, note brush spring tension and holder angle. Remove commutator bar connections carefully—solder joint positions matter for timing. Mark end bell position on stator housing with paint or tape. Document bearing type and condition.</p><h3>Removing Old Windings</h3><p>For small rotors, cutting coil ends and peeling away insulation works. For larger motors or delicate cores, heating to 250-350°C softens insulation, allowing coil stripping without damaging core laminations. Soak in caustic solution (sodium hydroxide) for heavy insulation removal. Work in well-ventilated area.</p><h3>Core Cleaning & Inspection</h3><p>Clean all slot walls and lamination surfaces with compressed air, wire brush, or cotton swabs. Remove all insulation fragments. Clean commutator bars—residual solder or copper particles cause shorts. Inspect core for damage or lamination separation. Check for cracks in core material; small cracks usually acceptable.</p><h3>Slot Insulation & Preparation</h3><p>Slot liners (mylar or fish paper) protect core from wire abrasion. Cut to size and insert before winding. For rotor slots, liner must extend slightly above slot opening. Secure with light adhesive or friction fit. Slot insulation thickness typically 0.5-1mm depending on voltage rating.</p><h3>Winding Process Step-by-Step</h3><p>Use winding frame to hold core. Wind coils in sequence: insert wire through slot pairs, form coil ends with consistent shape, wrap with tape between layers for larger coils. Maintain consistent turns per coil. Alternate winding directions (clockwise/counterclockwise) for alternating pole coils in some designs. Keep coil tension consistent.</p><h3>Coil Securing & Wedging</h3><p>After winding, secure coil ends with wedges or clips so they don't slip during operation. High-speed motors need solid wedges; low-speed can use semi-closed slots. Some motors use fiber or aluminum wedges driven into slot openings. Wedges prevent coil movement under centrifugal force and vibration.</p><h3>Commutator Bar Connection</h3><p>Solder connections must be strong and cool quickly (use wet sponge or heat sink). For commutator bar connections, solder to bar lug only—never to bar surface. Use rosin-core solder rated for wire size. Stagger connections to avoid high spots that interfere with brushes. Use flux-core solder for cleaner joints.</p><h3>Electrical Testing</h3><p>Insulation resistance test: Apply 500V DC megohm meter between winding and frame. Should read >10 MΩ when cold. Continuity test: Measure resistance between phases or circuits. Compare to similar motors or original measurements. Check for shorts between adjacent coils using megohm meter.</p></section><section id="wire-gauge"><h2>Wire Gauge & Current Tables</h2><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">AWG</th><th scope="col">Diameter (mm)</th><th scope="col">Ω/1000ft</th><th scope="col">Max Continuous (A)</th><th scope="col">Typical Use</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>18</td><td>1.02</td><td>6.51</td><td>14</td><td>Small servo, stepper</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>1.29</td><td>4.09</td><td>20</td><td>Stepper, small DC</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>1.63</td><td>2.57</td><td>32</td><td>Medium DC motor</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>2.05</td><td>1.62</td><td>41</td><td>Large DC motor</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>2.59</td><td>1.02</td><td>55</td><td>High-power motor</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>3.26</td><td>0.64</td><td>70</td><td>Industrial motor</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>4.11</td><td>0.41</td><td>95</td><td>Industrial, high-power</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Current Density & Wire Selection</h3><p>Current density is key metric: 3 A/mm² for continuous duty (fan cooled), 5 A/mm² for intermittent, 2 A/mm² for high reliability. A 25A motor might use 8.3 mm² wire at 3 A/mm² density. Wire with polyimide insulation (Kapton) handles higher temperatures (up to 220°C) than polyester (105-130°C).</p></section><section id="troubleshooting"><h2>Troubleshooting Flowchart</h2><p><strong>Motor won't start:</strong> Check power supply with multimeter. Check brushes on commutator. If brushes fouling, rotate brush holder slightly or clean commutator. Try gentle turning by hand to detect seized bearings. Use megohm meter to test insulation continuity. Check for mechanical binding.</p><p><strong>Weak rotation or stall:</strong> Check load—may exceed motor rating. Low supply voltage? Excessive brush wear? Dirty commutator causing poor contact. Test with no load first. Use ammeter to measure current—excessively high current indicates short circuit or overload. Test voltage at motor terminals under load.</p><p><strong>Excessive sparking:</strong> Bad brush contact—clean commutator with fine sandpaper and degreaser. Check brush spring tension. Brushes worn out—replace. Commutator bars out of round—true on lathe. Misaligned brushes—rotate holder to neutral plane. Some sparking at startup is normal; excessive sparking under load indicates problems.</p><p><strong>Overheating:</strong> Excessive current (overload or short). Poor ventilation. Bearing friction. Fan blade damaged or blocked. If temperature sensor equipped, check thermal cutout setting. Run only under design load after checking commutator condition. Allow motor to cool between heavy-use cycles.</p><p><strong>Noise or vibration:</strong> Loose rotor or shaft in bearings. Commutator runout (out of round). Unbalanced load. Remove rotor and spin manually—should rotate freely with minimal runout. Check end bell alignment and bolt tightness.</p></section><section id="improvised"><h2>Improvised Motor Construction</h2><h3>Simple DC Motor from Magnets & Wire</h3><p>Minimum parts: Two neodymium magnets, copper wire (coil), wooden frame, battery, thumbtacks or spring contacts (brushes). Create rectangular coil from 20 turns of 0.5mm copper wire. Solder ends to split ring (commutator) made from small plastic ring with copper tape on one side. Mount coil on wooden axle between magnets. Position thumbtack contacts at split point to power coil. Current flows through split ring in alternating direction as coil rotates, creating steady torque.</p><h3>Homemade Electromagnet Stator</h3><p>Wind 500-1000 turns of wire around bolt or iron rod. Coil around rotor core, spacing 4 poles 90 degrees apart. Connect to AC power with capacitor (capacitor-start design). Current in windings creates rotating field similar to industrial AC motor. Capacitor size: typical 5-10 µF for small motors.</p><h3>Commutator from Copper Foil</h3><p>Cut copper foil tape into segments and glue to plastic tube (film canister, PVC pipe). Space segments 2-3mm apart. Enamel insulation between segments. Wind fine wire axle through center. This improves on split-ring design, allowing more coils and smoother operation. Creates multi-coil smooth-running motor.</p><h3>Bearing Substitutes & Supports</h3><p>Plastic tubing, skateboard bearings, or ball bearings from salvaged motors work as simple bearings. For low-speed applications, wooden peg through drilled block can serve as rough bearing if lubricated with graphite powder or grease. Wooden bearing requires frequent relubrication to prevent seizing.</p></section><section id="generator"><h2>Generator & Motor Conversion</h2><h3>DC Motor as Generator</h3><p>DC motor becomes generator when turned by external mechanical input. Spin shaft and voltage appears at terminals. Output voltage = Kv × RPM, where Kv is motor's velocity constant (V/RPM). Motor rated 200 Kv at 1000 RPM generates 200V when spun at 1000 RPM. Load draws current in opposite direction to motoring: I = Load resistance × Voltage / R(internal).</p><h3>Induction Motor as Generator</h3><p>Induction motor can generate when spun above synchronous speed. Requires capacitor bank for voltage regulation (self-excitation). Terminal voltage varies with speed. Less practical than DC generation due to complexity of field control. Capacitor size must be tuned for stable voltage output.</p><h3>Stepper Motor as Generator</h3><p>Stepping motors generate low-voltage pulses when turned manually. Each step produces small voltage spike across one coil pair. Useful for low-speed measurement or very-low-power generation from mechanical systems (water wheel, wind vane). Output is pulsed rather than continuous.</p><h3>Gear Ratios for Power Optimization</h3><p>If source has high torque at low RPM (water wheel, wind turbine), gear up to higher RPM before generator input. Ratio = Output RPM / Input RPM. A 50:1 gear ratio on 60 RPM water wheel gives 3000 RPM input to generator. Choose gearing so motor operates near rated RPM for maximum efficiency. Gearing losses typically 5-10%.</p></section><section id="bearings"><h2>Bearing Maintenance & Replacement</h2><h3>Bearing Types in Motors</h3><p><strong>Sleeve bearings:</strong> Machined bore filled with lubricating oil. Common in older motors. Simple but require regular oiling. Typical clearance is 0.001-0.003" per inch of shaft diameter. Quieter than ball bearings at low speed.</p><p><strong>Ball bearings:</strong> Sealed or open, typically shielded. Require initial grease and periodic relubrication. Low friction, precise alignment, long life. Deep-groove ball bearings handle both radial and axial loads.</p><p><strong>Roller bearings:</strong> Handle radial loads better than balls. Less common in small motors but used in large industrial machines. Cylindrical or tapered rollers depending on load direction.</p><h3>Bearing Clearance & Preload</h3><p>Radial clearance (shaft to bearing bore) is critical: too tight = friction and heat; too loose = runout and noise. Typical clearance for ball bearing is C3 (normal, loose) to C4 (loose) for motors. C2 (tight) is for precision spindles only. Axial preload (thrust direction) is minimal in most motors but critical in high-speed applications.</p><h3>Relubrication Schedule</h3><p>Sealed ball bearings: typically never require additional lubrication—packed at manufacture. Open ball bearings: add grease annually for continuous-duty motors, every 2-3 years for intermittent use. Sleeve bearings: check oil level monthly, top up as needed. Old oil becomes varnished; drain and refill every 1-2 years. Use correct bearing grease type.</p><h3>Bearing Removal & Installation</h3><p>Heat bearing to 80-100°C with heat gun to expand it slightly, then tap gently with soft mallet to slide off shaft. Alternatively, use puller (3-jaw puller). Installation: gentle pressure on inner race, never on outer race. Use bearing press if available. Press ensures perpendicular installation without damaging bearing. Never drive on outer race during installation.</p></section><section id="mistakes"><h2>Common Mistakes</h2><ul><li><strong>Oversizing wire gauge:</strong> Thick wire takes longer to rewind, harder to fit coils in slots, and doesn't necessarily increase power. Follow original wire size unless design is being modified.</li><li><strong>Wrong commutator bar connection:</strong> Each bar connects to two coil ends. Connecting to wrong bars reverses pole pattern and causes severe sparking or no rotation. Reference pre-disassembly photos carefully.</li><li><strong>Insufficient slot insulation:</strong> Bare copper wire against steel laminations causes shorts. Always use slot liners, even in simple motors.</li><li><strong>Poor brush contact:</strong> Brushes must sit at neutral plane. Incorrect positioning causes excessive sparking and fast wear. Adjust by rotating brush holder until sparking is minimal.</li><li><strong>Using regular solder on high-current connections:</strong> Lead-free solder has high resistance when thin. Use silver-bearing solder for low resistance and strength on commutator connections.</li><li><strong>Ignoring ventilation gaps:</strong> Some motors have cooling fins or ducts. Blocking these causes overheating. Clean cooling paths before reassembly.</li><li><strong>Not testing insulation resistance:</strong> Test with megohm meter before operation. Short between coils means rewinding failed and motor will draw excessive current and trip breakers.</li></ul></section><div class="warning"><strong>Safety Warning:</strong> Large motors store energy in magnetic fields and capacitors. Discharge capacitors before service. Rotating shafts can catch hair and clothing—remove jewelry and loose clothing. High-voltage motors can deliver lethal shock—verify power is off and locked out before work.</div><div class="tip"><strong>Efficiency Tip:</strong> Motors operate most efficiently near full load. Running at 50% load causes higher I²R losses and lower efficiency. Choose motor size to match typical load.</div><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="electrical-generation.html">Power Generation</a><a href="electrical-wiring.html">Electrical Wiring</a><a href="power-distribution.html">Power Distribution</a><a href="transistors.html">Transistors & Semiconductors</a><a href="automotive-alternator-repurposing.html">Alternator Repurposing</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
