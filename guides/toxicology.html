Cholinergic (excess acetylcholine): pinpoint pupils, drooling, muscle twitching, respiratory distress. Anticholinergic: dilated pupils, dry mouth, agitation, hallucinations, increased heart rate. CNS depressants: altered consciousness, slow breathing, low blood pressure. CNS stimulants: agitation, rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, seizures.</p></section><section id="chemical"><h2>Common Chemical Toxins</h2><h3>Organophosphates and Carbamates (Insecticides)</h3><p><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Inhibit acetylcholinesterase, causing acetylcholine accumulation. <strong>Symptoms:</strong> SLUDGE (Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Defecation, GI upset, Emesis) + pinpoint pupils, muscle fasciculations, respiratory distress, seizures. <strong>Timeline:</strong> Acute onset (minutes to hours). <strong>Treatment:</strong> Atropine (blocks acetylcholine effects) IV 2-5mg initial, repeat every 5-10 minutes until signs of atropinization (dry mouth, increased heart rate, dilated pupils). Pralidoxime (PAM) regenerates cholinesterase if available. Decontamination: remove clothing, thorough skin washing.</p><h3>Corrosive Substances (Acids/Bases)</h3><p><strong>Acids (sulfuric, hydrochloric, nitric):</strong> Cause tissue coagulation, may be less destructive than bases due to more superficial burn. <strong>Bases (ammonia, sodium hydroxide):</strong> Liquefactive necrosis, deeper penetration, more severe injury. <strong>Symptoms:</strong> Burning mouth/throat, difficulty swallowing, drooling, vomiting blood. <strong>Treatment:</strong> DO NOT induce vomiting (re-exposure to esophagus). Dilute: small sips water or milk if conscious. Do NOT neutralize (chemical reaction generates heat). Seek professional care urgently (risk esophageal stricture, perforation).</p><h3>Carbon Monoxide</h3><p><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Binds hemoglobin with 200-250x higher affinity than oxygen, prevents oxygen delivery. <strong>Symptoms:</strong> Mild (headache, dizziness), moderate (confusion, ataxia, syncope), severe (coma, seizures, death). <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Carboxyhemoglobin level if available (>20% diagnostic). <strong>Treatment:</strong> Move to fresh air immediately. High-flow oxygen (100% O2) accelerates CO elimination (reduces half-life from 4+ hours to 1-2 hours). Hyperbaric oxygen (if available) further reduces half-life to 20-30 minutes; indicated if severe symptoms, coma, pregnancy, or COHb >25-40%.</p><h3>Cyanide</h3><p><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Binds cytochrome oxidase, blocks cellular respiration even with adequate oxygen. <strong>Symptoms:</strong> Rapid onset: headache, rapid breathing, confusion, loss of consciousness, cardiac arrhythmias, coma. <strong>Sources:</strong> Smoke inhalation (fires), pesticides, industrial accidents. <strong>Treatment:</strong> Remove from source. Oxygen therapy. If available: cyanide antidote kit (hydroxocobalamin, or older sodium nitrite/thiosulfate) IV. Hydroxocobalamin: 5g IV directly binds cyanide, converting to cyanocobalamin (excreted). No more effective than supportive care without antidote, but prevents progression.</p></section><section id="plants"><h2>Toxic Plants</h2><h3>Common Toxic Plants</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Plant<th scope="row">Toxic Part<th scope="row">Symptoms<th scope="row">Management<tr><td>Hemlock<td>All parts (especially roots)<td>Burning mouth, salivation, tremors, paralysis, respiratory failure<td>Supportive care; no specific antidote<tr><td>Castor bean (ricin)<td>Seeds<td>GI upset, diarrhea, severe dehydration, hepatotoxicity<td>Supportive care, aggressive fluid replacement<tr><td>Oleander<td>All parts (especially leaves)<td>GI upset, cardiac arrhythmias, hyperkalemia<td>Monitor ECG, cardiac support, activated charcoal<tr><td>Foxglove (digitalis)<td>Leaves, seeds<td>Nausea, arrhythmias, hyperkalemia<td>Cardiac monitoring, dialysis, digitalis antidote (digoxin-specific antibodies) if available<tr><td>Deadly nightshade (belladonna)<td>Berries, leaves<td>Anticholinergic: dilated pupils, dry mouth, agitation, hallucinations<td>Cool environment, sedation, physostigmine if severe</table><h3>Mushroom Toxins</h3><p><strong>Amanita phalloides (death cap):</strong> Alpha-amanitin inhibits RNA polymerase, causes liver/kidney failure. Latency 6-24 hours (deceptive), then GI symptoms, liver failure. Mortality >50% without treatment. <strong>Management:</strong> Aggressive decontamination (activated charcoal, hemodialysis), milk thistle (silymarin) if available, supportive care through liver recovery. <strong>Ibotenic acid (Amanita muscaria, fly agaric):</strong> Produces intoxication (euphoria, hallucinations, confusion), usually self-limited. Management: supportive, safety monitoring. <strong>Psilocybin mushrooms:</strong> Hallucinogenic, mild toxicity; management supportive (reassurance, safe environment).</p></section><section id="animals"><h2>Animal Toxins</h2><h3>Snake Venom</h3><p><strong>Hemotoxic venom (rattlesnake, viper):</strong> Tissue destruction, swelling, coagulopathy, shock. <strong>Neurotoxic (cobra, coral snake):</strong> Respiratory paralysis, minimal local swelling. <strong>Management:</strong> Immobilize bitten limb below heart, remove constrictive items (rings, bracelets). Do NOT cut/suck (ineffective, causes more damage). Elevate if possible to reduce swelling. Antivenom if available (species-specific; CroFab or Anavip in US for North American snakes). Supportive care: fluids, pain management, monitor for coagulopathy, respiratory status. Complications: compartment syndrome (may require fasciotomy), chronic swelling.</p><h3>Insect Venom (Bee, Wasp)</h3><p><strong>Local reaction:</strong> Localized swelling/pain. <strong>Systemic reaction (anaphylaxis):</strong> Urticaria, angioedema, respiratory distress, hypotension, shock. <strong>Management:</strong> Local: remove stinger (scrape off, don't squeeze), ice, NSAIDs, antihistamines. Anaphylaxis: epinephrine IM 0.3-0.5mg (upper thigh), then antihistamines, corticosteroids. Monitor for biphasic reaction (return of symptoms 12+ hours later); may need repeat epinephrine. Prevent re-exposure: avoid nest locations, protective clothing, consider desensitization if history anaphylaxis.</p><h3>Marine Toxins</h3><p><strong>Stingray/sea urchin sting:</strong> Local pain, inflammation, possible venom. Management: immerse in hot water (45°C/113°F for 45 minutes) to inactivate venom, remove spines, clean wound. <strong>Scombroid poisoning (histamine from fish):</strong> Flushing, itching, headache, diarrhea. Usually self-limited. Management: antihistamines, supportive care. <strong>Ciguatera (from reef fish toxin):</strong> GI upset, neurological symptoms (paresthesias, muscle weakness, cold reversal—sensation of hot/cold opposite). Chronic symptoms possible. Management: supportive, IV calcium for neurological symptoms, avoid affected fish species.</p></section><section id="management"><h2>Poisoning Management Protocol</h2><h3>Initial Assessment and Stabilization</h3><ol><li>Scene safety: ensure no ongoing exposure risk<li>ABCs: maintain airway, breathing, circulation<li>Decontamination: remove from source, remove contaminated clothing<li>Identify poison: label, substance name, amount (if possible)<li>Time of exposure: critical for timing of treatment<li>Vital signs and symptoms: establish baseline<li>Consider transport to facility if available; otherwise, proceed with available treatments</ol><h3>Activated Charcoal (Adsorption)</h3><p>Binds toxins in GI tract, preventing absorption. Dose: 50-100g (or 1g/kg). Mix with water to slurry. Give orally if conscious/can protect airway. Effective for many drugs and poisons if given within 1-2 hours of ingestion. Ineffective for: alcohols (methanol, ethylene glycol), metals (iron, lithium), corrosives. Do NOT use if altered consciousness (aspiration risk). Follow with cathartic (sorbitol) to promote bowel evacuation.</p><h3>Induced Vomiting (NOT Recommended)</h3><p>Previously used but now contraindicated in most cases: risk of aspiration, re-exposure to esophagus (corrosives), and adverse effects of emetic agents themselves. Exception: specific poisons in non-compromised airway within short time. Generally: avoid. Gastric lavage (stomach pumping) similarly used less frequently; risks aspiration, esophageal damage.</p><h3>Supportive Care</h3><p>Most poisonings managed supportively: maintain airway and breathing, maintain circulation (fluids, vasopressors if available), manage specific symptoms (seizures = benzodiazepines, hyperthermia = cooling measures). Monitor vital signs closely. Specific antidotes for specific poisons (naloxone for opioids, fomepizole for alcohols, etc.) if available.</p></section><section id="decontamination"><h2>Decontamination</h2><h3>Chemical Exposure Decontamination</h3><p><strong>Skin exposure:</strong> Remove contaminated clothing carefully (avoid self-contamination). Wash extensively with water/soap (thorough skin decontamination more important than rapid decontamination). 5-10 minutes minimum; continue if irritation persists. <strong>Eye exposure:</strong> Irrigate with water or saline for 15-20 minutes minimum; flush inner eyelid. <strong>Inhalation:</strong> Move to fresh air immediately; provide oxygen if available. <strong>Ingestion:</strong> Rinse mouth with water; do NOT induce vomiting unless directed; consider activated charcoal.</p><h3>Biological Contamination (Blood/Body Fluids)</h3><p>Use appropriate PPE (gloves, gown, mask). Clean with soap and water first (removes most organisms). Disinfect with 0.5% bleach (1 part household bleach to 9 parts water) or 70% alcohol. Allow contact time per disinfectant type. Properly dispose of contaminated materials.</p><h3>Decontamination of Rescuers</h3><p>First responders at hazmat scenes require decontamination before leaving scene/treating patients: remove outer clothing, thorough shower/washing, fresh clothing. Prevents spread of contamination to other patients, healthcare facility. In survival: similar principle—decontaminate self before treating others or handling supplies.</p></section><section id="antidotes"><h2>Antidotes and Specific Treatments</h2><h3>Antidotes by Toxin</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Poison<th scope="row">Antidote<th scope="row">Dose/Route<th scope="row">Mechanism<tr><td>Opioids<td>Naloxone (Narcan)<td>0.4-2mg IV/IM/IN, repeat every 2-3 min<td>Competes for opioid receptors; reverses respiratory depression<tr><td>Anticholinergics<td>Physostigmine<td>1-2mg IV slow, repeat every 20-30 min<td>Inhibits acetylcholinesterase; increases acetylcholine to counter anticholinergic effect<tr><td>Methanol/ethylene glycol<td>Fomepizole<td>15mg/kg IV loading, then 10mg/kg q12h<td>Inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase; prevents toxic metabolite formation<tr><td>Acetaminophen overdose<td>N-acetylcysteine (NAC)<td>Loading 140mg/kg PO, then 70mg/kg q4h<td>Replenishes glutathione; prevents hepatotoxicity<tr><td>Iron overdose<td>Deferoxamine<td>15mg/kg/hr IV infusion<td>Chelates iron; removes from circulation</table></section><section id="safety"><div class="warning"><h3>Critical Poisoning Response Warnings</h3><ul><li>Unknown poison identity = assume life-threatening. Treat symptomatically, decontaminate, monitor closely for progression.<li>Corrosive ingestion = do NOT induce vomiting. Dilute with small sips water/milk only. Seek professional care urgently (risk esophageal perforation, stricture formation).<li>Cyanide exposure = rapid deterioration possible. Remove from source immediately, give oxygen, prepare for cardiac arrest.<li>Altered consciousness + toxic exposure = airway compromise risk.
