Over-sizing systems wastes materials; under-sizing results in insufficient power.</p><h3>Load Assessment:</h3><p>Calculate average daily energy needs in watt-hours (Wh). Lighting: 40W bulb x 6 hours = 240Wh. Refrigeration: 300W average consumption x 8 hours = 2400Wh. Cooking: 1000W stove x 2 hours = 2000Wh. Total: approximately 4640Wh per day (5 kWh/day).</p><h3>Resource Assessment:</h3><ul><li><strong>Biomass:</strong> Can you sustainably produce 20-30kg dry wood daily? Gasifiers require consistent fuel.</li><li><strong>Solar:</strong> Latitude affects output. At 45° latitude, expect 2-4 peak sun hours daily average.</li><li><strong>Wind:</strong> Average wind speed determines turbine viability. Minimum 3m/s average wind speed for economic generation.</li><li><strong>Water:</strong> Flow rate (liters/second) and elevation drop (meters) determine micro-hydro output.</li></ul><h3>System Redundancy:</h3><p>Design multiple complementary systems. Solar alone fails in winter/cloudy periods. Wind alone unreliable in calm regions. Combined systems (solar + wind + backup generator) provide year-round reliability.</p><div class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Start with single system (often solar thermal for heating), add generation capacity over time. Rushing to implement all systems simultaneously often results in expensive mistakes and underutilized infrastructure.</div></section><section id="wood-gasification"><h2>Wood Gasification Systems</h2><p>Wood gasification converts solid wood into combustible gas (syngas), enabling cleaner burning and more efficient energy extraction than direct combustion.</p><h3>Wood Gasification Principle:</h3><p>Heat wood to 700-1000°C in oxygen-limited environment. Complex wood molecules break down into gas components (carbon monoxide, hydrogen, methane, carbon dioxide). Syngas burns hotter and cleaner than wood smoke. Charcoal byproduct has high energy density.</p><h3>Downdraft Gasifier Design (Simplest for Survival):</h3><p>Vertical cylinder (30cm diameter, 1.5m tall) with fuel hopper at top. Wood enters as it's consumed. Combustion zone at bottom creates gas that exits through outlet port (1.5m down from top). Gas is filtered before use.</p><h3>Operation & Efficiency:</h3><ol><li>Fill hopper with 5-15cm diameter wood pieces (20% moisture content ideal)</li><li>Heat gasifier initially using direct fire (5-10 minute startup)</li><li>Wood begins gasifying when combustion zone reaches operating temperature (800°C+)</li><li>Output gas has 3-6 MJ/m³ energy density (vs. 35 MJ/m³ for natural gas, but usable for heating/cooking)</li><li>Continuous operation requires regular fuel addition (typically 5-10kg wood per hour for 20kW output)</li><li>Efficiency: 60-75% (better than 30-40% for direct wood burning)</li></ol><h3>Syngas Applications:</h3><ul><li><strong>Cooking:</strong> Direct jet burner under pot</li><li><strong>Water heating:</strong> Heat exchanger system</li><li><strong>Engine power:</strong> Modified engines can run on syngas (requires expertise; typically advanced technology)</li><li><strong>Space heating:</strong> Radiant heat system</li></ul><h3>Safety Considerations:</h3><p>Syngas contains carbon monoxide (toxic). Never operate gasifier indoors without proper venting. Exhaust must be vented outside continuously. Gasifier develops high pressure if outlet is blocked—install pressure relief valve.</p></section><section id="solar-thermal"><h2>Solar Thermal Systems</h2><p>Solar thermal systems convert sunlight to heat directly (simpler than photovoltaic electricity). Excellent for water heating, space heating, and food cooking.</p><h3>Simple Solar Water Heater (Passive System):</h3><p><strong>Design:</strong> Black water tank (50-200L) insulated on bottom and sides, topped with glass or clear plastic. Dark color absorbs heat; insulation retains it.</p><h3>Construction:</h3><ol><li>Build insulated box (plywood sides, 5cm straw/cellulose insulation)</li><li>Paint interior surfaces matte black</li><li>Install metal or dark rubber water container inside</li><li>Cover top with glass panel (13mm minimum, secured to prevent breakage)</li><li>Angle box toward south at latitude angle (45° at 45° latitude)</li><li>Temperature rise: 20-30°C above ambient in full sun</li><li>Freeze protection: drain or insulate heavily in cold regions</li></ol><h3>Solar Cooking (Box Cooker):</h3><p>Insulated box with glass top, dark cooking surface inside. Temperature reaches 100-150°C in sunny conditions. Can slow-cook food, pasteurize water, sterilize containers. Requires 4-8 hours cooking time for typical meal.</p><h3>Solar Space Heating:</h3><p>Thermal mass (stone, water, adobe) absorbs daytime heat, releasing it at night. Proper orientation (south-facing windows in northern hemisphere) maximizes winter solar gain while minimizing summer overheating through overhang design.</p><h3>Efficiency & Output:</h3><p>Solar intensity: 1000 W/m² in full sun. Simple solar heater with 1m² black surface in full sun produces approximately 700W heat output (accounting for losses). Useful for modest heating applications; insufficient for large-scale heating alone.</p></section><section id="wind-power"><h2>Wind Power Generation</h2><p>Wind turbines convert kinetic energy to electricity. Effectiveness depends heavily on wind resource assessment.</p><h3>Wind Resource Requirements:</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Average Wind Speed</th><th scope="row">Viability</th><th scope="row">Typical Site</th></tr><tr><td>2 m/s</td><td>Not viable</td><td>Sheltered valley</td></tr><tr><td>3-4 m/s</td><td>Marginal</td><td>Open country</td></tr><tr><td>4-5 m/s</td><td>Good</td><td>Exposed hills</td></tr><tr><td>5+ m/s</td><td>Excellent</td><td>Coastal, elevated ridges</td></tr></table><p>Measure wind speed at intended turbine height (10m minimum). Wind speed increases with height: double height roughly increases wind speed 10%.</p><h3>Small Wind Turbine Design (DIY Practical):</h3><p>Vertical-axis turbine (Savonius rotor) easier to build than horizontal-axis. 1m height, 0.5m diameter rotor produces 50-150W in 5 m/s wind. Output power scales with swept area and wind speed cubed (doubling wind speed = 8x power increase).</p><h3>Turbine Construction:</h3><ol><li>Create rotor from curved blade material (PVC pipe, wood, sheet metal)</li><li>Mount on vertical shaft with bearings</li><li>Connect to generator (permanent magnet alternator, 12V or 48V)</li><li>Install on tower (minimum 8-10m height for clear wind)</li><li>Add controller to regulate output voltage</li><li>Store power in battery bank</li></ol><h3>Power Output & Capacity:</h3><p>A 1kW small turbine in average 5 m/s wind produces approximately 1000-1500 kWh annually. Larger turbines scale to 5-10kW practical for survival situations. Cost-benefit analysis often favors solar in low-wind regions.</p></section><section id="micro-hydro"><h2>Micro-Hydro Systems</h2><p>Micro-hydro exploits flowing water to generate electricity continuously. If water resource exists year-round, often provides most reliable renewable power.</p><h3>Micro-Hydro Potential Calculation:</h3><p><strong>Formula:</strong> Power (W) = flow (liters/second) × drop (meters) × 10 (simplified)</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> 100 liters/second flowing 10 meters down = 100 × 10 × 10 = 10,000W (10kW) potential power.</p><h3>Site Assessment:</h3><ol><li>Measure flow rate: dam small section, collect water in bucket, measure time. Flow = bucket volume / time.</li><li>Measure elevation drop (head): use contour maps, altimeter, or improvised level (rubber tube filled with water).</li><li>Calculate potential power using formula above</li><li>Assess feasibility: can you deliver water through pipeline to turbine location?</li></ol><h3>Micro-Hydro System Components:</h3><ul><li><strong>Intake:</strong> Diverts water from stream; simple dam or diversion channel</li><li><strong>Penstock:</strong> Pipe delivering water to turbine (gravity feed system). Typical: 3-10cm diameter, 50-300 meters length</li><li><strong>Turbine:</strong> Converts water flow to rotational energy. Types: pelton wheel (high head, low flow), turgo wheel (medium head), crossflow (low head, high flow)</li><li><strong>Generator:</strong> Attached to turbine shaft; converts rotation to electricity</li><li><strong>Load controller:</strong> Regulates flow to maintain constant output voltage</li></ul><h3>Pelton Wheel Construction (Highest Efficiency for Survival):</h3><p>Jet of water strikes individual buckets on wheel perimeter, transferring energy. Simple design: cup-shaped buckets welded to wheel hub. Requires 30+ meters elevation drop for useful power. Efficiency: 85-90% (superior to other turbine types).</p></section><section id="biogas"><h2>Biogas Production</h2><p>Anaerobic digestion of organic waste produces methane-rich biogas. Useful for cooking, heating, or electricity generation. Provides waste management benefit simultaneously.</p><h3>Biogas System Principle:</h3><p>Bacteria decompose organic matter in oxygen-free (anaerobic) environment. Typical feedstock: animal manure, plant waste, food scraps. Process requires 20-40°C temperature (kept warm by digester insulation or by using some biogas output).</p><h3>Simple Biogas Digester Design:</h3><p><strong>Floating drum digester:</strong> Underground concrete or brick tank (1-10m³ volume). Movable gas drum on top collects methane. Inlet at bottom for feedstock; outlet at top for spent slurry removal.</p><h3>Operation Parameters:</h3><ul><li><strong>Temperature:</strong> 25-35°C optimal (psychrophilic bacteria); slower at lower temps but more stable</li><li><strong>Feedstock mix:</strong> 1:1 animal manure to plant material optimal</li><li><strong>Loading rate:</strong> 2-5kg feedstock per m³ digester volume per day</li><li><strong>Retention time:</strong> 20-40 days (varies by temperature and feedstock)</li><li><strong>Gas production:</strong> 0.1-0.3 m³ biogas per kg feedstock (typical)</li></ul><h3>Biogas Composition & Use:</h3><p>Biogas is 55-70% methane, 30-40% carbon dioxide, 1-3% other gases. Methane energy content: 35 MJ/m³. Typical household digester (5m³) produces 5-15 m³ biogas daily—sufficient for 1-2 hours cooking on standard stove, or 50-100W continuous electricity generation.</p><h3>Safety Systems:</h3><p>Install pressure relief valve (prevents over-pressurization). Trap water in gas line (prevents condensation in pipes). Install flame trap to prevent backflash into digester. Regular venting of hydrogen sulfide prevents corrosion and odor.</p></section><section id="fuel-cells"><h2>Fuel Cells & Hydrogen</h2><p>Fuel cells generate electricity through chemical reaction (typically hydrogen + oxygen → water + electricity). Produces only water as waste. Complex technology but increasingly feasible for survival situations.</p><h3>Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cell:</h3><p>Simplest type. Hydrogen gas enters anode, oxygen enters cathode. Electrons flow through external circuit, generating electricity. Water exits as byproduct. Efficient: 50-60% electrical conversion (excellent for power generation).</p><h3>Hydrogen Production for Survival:</h3><p><strong>Electrolysis:</strong> Pass electricity through water to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Energy input: 40-50 kWh per kg hydrogen. Hydrogen energy content: 120-140 MJ/kg. Efficiency round-trip (electricity → hydrogen → electricity): 25-35%.</p><p><strong>Thermochemical water splitting:</strong> Use high heat (solar or reactor heat) to split water. Theoretical efficiency: 40-50%. Requires 700-900°C temperatures. Advanced technology but possible with solar concentration.</p><h3>Hydrogen Storage & Safety:</h3><p>Compressed hydrogen (200-350 bar) requires strong metal cylinders. Liquefied hydrogen (-253°C) requires insulation and complex handling. For survival: compressed gas in steel tank is most practical. Safety: hydrogen highly flammable; requires explosion-proof equipment and outdoor storage.</p><h3>Practical Survival Application:</h3><p>Fuel cells are complex and require specialized materials. More practical for established communities than isolated survival situations. Cost remains prohibitive for most survival applications (hydrogen storage costs $5000+).</p></section><section id="energy-storage"><h2>Energy Storage Systems</h2><p>Renewable sources are intermittent. Storage allows use of generated power during periods when generation drops (nighttime, calm weather).</p><h3>Battery Storage (Most Practical):</h3><p><strong>Lead-acid batteries:</strong> 12-48V systems practical. Capacity: 100-500 Ah per bank (1.2-24 kWh storage). Cost: $200-500 per kWh. Lifespan: 5-10 years. Maintenance: water refilling, terminal cleaning.</p><p><strong>Lithium batteries:</strong> Higher cost ($800-1500/kWh) but longer life (10-15 years), better round-trip efficiency (95% vs. 85%), and lighter weight. Premium for survival applications with space constraints.</p><h3>Pumped Hydro Storage:</h3><p>Pump water uphill during surplus generation, release through turbine during shortage. Very large scale (100+ meter elevation, 1+ million liter storage) for practical capacity. Home-scale version: small pond with pump system (feasible but complex).</p><h3>Thermal Storage:</h3><p>Store heat in insulated tanks. Water storage: 4.2 kJ/kg-K capacity. Rock bed storage: 0.8-1.0 kJ/kg-K capacity. Phase-change materials (salt hydrates): 200+ kJ/kg (expensive but compact). Phase-change storage reduces volume 50-70% versus water.</p><h3>Compressed Air Storage:</h3><p>Compress air into sealed tank during surplus generation. Release to run turbine/motor during shortage. Round-trip efficiency: 40-50%. Practical for 10-100 kWh storage. Requires strong pressure vessel (expensive).</p></section><section id="efficiency"><h2>Efficiency & Conservation</h2><p>Efficiency improvements often cost less than generation capacity expansion. Reducing load by 20% requires 20% less generation capacity.</p><h3>Heating Efficiency:</h3><ul><li><strong>Insulation:</strong> R-value 20+ saves 50% heating energy versus uninsulated structure</li><li><strong>Passive solar:</strong> Proper window placement provides 20-40% of heating needs</li><li><strong>Thermal mass:</strong> Stone/water storage moderates temperature swings, reducing active heating</li></ul><h3>Lighting Efficiency:</h3><ul><li><strong>LED:</strong> 80-90% more efficient than incandescent. 100-hour bulb life → 50,000 hour life</li><li><strong>Daylighting:</strong> Mirrors, skylights, and reflective surfaces reduce electric lighting 30-50%</li><li><strong>Task lighting:</strong> Illuminate work area only; avoid full-room lighting</li></ul><h3>Appliance Efficiency:</h3><ul><li><strong>Refrigeration:</strong> Superinsulation reduces power 30-50%. Nighttime ice production uses waste heat</li><li><strong>Cooking:</strong> Pressure cookers reduce energy 20-30%. Solar cooking eliminates fuel use</li><li><strong>Water heating:</strong> Insulation on tank/pipes saves 15-30%</li></ul></section><section id="common-mistakes"><h2>Common Mistakes & Solutions</h2><h3>Mistake 1: Over-Optimistic Resource Assessment</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Assuming wind/sun/water resource is better than actual measured data. Designing system for peak conditions rather than average. Results: system fails to meet needs 80% of time.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Measure resources for minimum 1 month (better: full year). Design for average conditions, not peaks. Add 30% safety factor to capacity calculations.</p><h3>Mistake 2: Insufficient Energy Storage</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Installing generation capacity without proportional storage. Battery bank sized for 4 hours, but cloudy periods last 3 days. Results: frequent power shortages despite adequate generation capacity.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Storage should equal 2-5 days worth of average consumption. Seasonal variation requires 30-50 day storage in temperate climates with winter cloudiness.</p><h3>Mistake 3: Inadequate System Monitoring</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Implementing system without gauges/meters. Battery state unknown; overly discharged batteries die prematurely. Generator output unmonitored; inefficient operation.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Install DC volt/amperage meters on all circuits. Fuel usage gauges on gasifiers. Visual water level gauges on storage tanks. Monitor daily to identify problems early.</p><h3>Mistake 4: Poor Generator Maintenance</h3><p><strong>Error:</strong> Neglecting fuel stabilization, filter changes, load testing. Carburetor gets varnish; unit fails when needed.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Change oil monthly. Stabilize fuel. Run generator 30 minutes monthly under load. Replace filters annually.</p></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="con-01-shelter-building.html">Shelter Building (for Insulation)</a><a href="cra-01-forging-metalwork.html">Forging & Metalwork (for Tool Making)</a><a href="cra-02-pottery-ceramics.html">Pottery (for Vessels)</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
