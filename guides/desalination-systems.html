Dig a hole approximately 1 meter wide and 0.6 meters deep in sandy soil. Place a container or basin at the bottom to collect distilled water. Line the bottom of the pit with black material (old plastic sheeting, rubber, or charred wood) to absorb maximum solar heat.</p><p>Arrange the saltwater source (brine or brackish water) around the collection basin using pieces of wood, cloth, or rubber to create wicks that extend from the water source to the black absorber material. Cover the entire pit with clear plastic sheeting held down at the edges with rocks or soil. The plastic must form a tight seal with an angled roof shape so condensation runs down toward the center and drips into the collection container.</p><h3>Yield and Performance</h3><p>A properly constructed ground solar still produces 1-2 liters per day under ideal sunny conditions. Yield depends on pit size, water depth, ambient temperature, and sun intensity. Larger surface areas produce proportionally more water, though deeper pits suffer diminishing returns due to heat loss.</p><h3>Enhancements with Black Material and Wicks</h3><p>Line the bottom with the blackest available material to maximize solar absorption. Charred fabric, burnt rubber, or black-painted wood works well. Place multiple wicks extending from the brine source to the absorber—these increase evaporation surface area by drawing more saltwater into contact with the heated material. Use lightweight fabric or frayed rope that wicks water efficiently. The key is creating maximum surface area for evaporation while maintaining steady liquid transport.</p></section><section id=fire-distillation><h2>Distillation by Fire</h2><h3>Pot-and-Tube Method</h3><p>For faster desalination, use direct heat from fire or hot coals. Fill a large metal pot with saltwater. Create a covered condenser by running flexible tubing (copper, rubber, or cloth) from the pot's lid. The tube should exit and then coil through cold water in a secondary container (a bucket or trough). As saltwater boils, steam enters the tube, cools in the water bath, and condenses back to pure liquid water that drips into a collection vessel.</p><p>Ensure the boiling pot sits at a higher level than the condenser tube so condensed water gravity-feeds out without backing up. Keep the cold water bath constantly refreshed with cold or running water to maintain condensation efficiency. A bamboo or metal condenser tube with multiple cooling coils increases surface area for heat exchange.</p><h3>Yield and Fuel Efficiency</h3><p>The pot-and-tube method produces 3-5 liters per hour under steady fire, making it useful for larger quantities when fuel and time permit. Fuel efficiency improves significantly when using rocket stoves or vertical-draft burners that concentrate heat around the boiling vessel. Position the condenser to extract maximum value from exhaust heat by placing it in the rising hot air stream above the fire.</p><h3>Scale Maintenance</h3><p>Saltwater contains minerals that precipitate and accumulate as scale inside the boiling pot. This reduces heat transfer efficiency and can eventually clog pipes. Periodically drain the pot and scrape away mineral deposits using a brush or cloth. Vinegar or weak acid solutions dissolve scale more easily. Prevent rapid scale buildup by maintaining moderate, steady heat rather than fierce boiling, and by partially replacing the brine water periodically with less concentrated saltwater or brackish sources.</p></section><section id=multi-effect><h2>Multi-Effect Solar Distillation</h2><h3>Stacked Tray Design</h3><p>A multi-effect solar still stacks multiple shallow trays to use heat more efficiently. The basic concept involves placing a dark tray containing saltwater under glass or clear plastic. Above it, place a second tray at a slight angle, also under transparent cover. Heat from the first tray evaporates saltwater; the steam rises and condenses on the underside of the upper tray. This condensation drips down and heats the lower tray, creating a cascade of heat reuse.</p><p>Each additional layer adds another heat transfer cycle, significantly improving overall water production. Construct the frame from wood or salvaged materials, spacing trays 5-10 cm apart. Use clear plastic or glass panels tilted at 20-30 degrees to the horizontal so condensation naturally runs toward collection channels at the bottom of each panel.</p><h3>Heat of Condensation and Construction Details</h3><p>The key thermodynamic principle is capturing latent heat released when steam condenses. Each liter of water that condenses releases approximately 2,260 kilojoules of heat—enough to evaporate another portion of saltwater in the tray below. Insulate the bottom and sides with straw, leaves, or foam to minimize heat loss to ground. Paint internal surfaces black to absorb maximum solar radiation.</p><p>Construct the structure so it withstands wind and allows easy cleaning. Provide drainage channels at the bottom of each layer to collect condensed freshwater separately from the brine. Use weather-resistant materials that tolerate heat cycling without warping or cracking.</p><h3>Yield Performance</h3><p>A well-designed multi-effect solar still produces 3-6 liters per square meter per day, significantly better than simple ground stills. Four-effect systems can achieve 6-10 liters per square meter per day under optimal solar conditions. Yield increases with latitude-appropriate tilt angles and regular cleaning of transparent covers.</p></section><section id=reverse-osmosis><h2>Improvised Reverse Osmosis</h2><h3>Salvage Targets and Sources</h3><p>Reverse osmosis membranes are robust and long-lasting. Search for home water treatment systems, boat watermakers, and commercial water filtration equipment that may be abandoned or available for salvage. A typical RO membrane remains functional for 5-10 years. Even partially degraded membranes continue producing some desalted water, though at reduced rates.</p><p>Examine the membrane's specifications to understand its rated capacity and pressure requirements, typically 200-1000 PSI (pounds per square inch) depending on salt concentration. Collect the membrane cartridge and any associated plumbing connections and fittings.</p><h3>Pressure Generation Concepts</h3><p>The challenge with improvised RO is generating sufficient pressure without electricity. Several methods work: a hand-pump pressurizer can achieve 100+ PSI of sustained pressure with effort. Elevated water towers use gravity; a 30-meter head provides roughly 30 PSI. A bicycle pump rigged with valves and a pressure accumulator tank can generate working pressure. Solar-powered DC pumps paired with a battery bank offer moderate-pressure solutions.</p><p>Direct brine water (seawater) pressurized through a membrane yields pure water and concentrated brine. A single pass produces 30-50% pure water depending on conditions. Optimal brine management involves recirculating failed permeate back through the membrane to avoid rapid fouling and maximize total freshwater recovery.</p><h3>System Integration</h3><p>Feed pressurized seawater to the high-pressure side of the membrane. Pure water emerges from the permeate outlet; concentrated brine exits the reject port at slightly lower pressure. Include sediment pre-filtration (sand, cloth, or 5-micron cartridge) upstream of the RO membrane to prevent clogging. The membrane should be flushed regularly with low-pressure freshwater to dissolve salt buildup and extend operational life.</p></section><section id=water-quality><h2>Water Quality Verification</h2><h3>Taste Test</h3><p>Distilled water tastes flat and slightly odd to most people—this is normal and harmless, a result of dissolved mineral removal. Taste a small sample before consuming larger quantities to confirm it's free from salt and chemical contamination. If saltiness persists, the desalination process failed or the collecting container was contaminated. If the water smells or tastes chemical, the source water contained petroleum products or other contaminants that survived distillation.</p><h3>Mineral Addition for Distilled Water</h3><p>While pure distilled water is safe, mineral-free water consumed long-term can leach minerals from the body. Add trace minerals back to distilled water by stirring in a small amount of salt (1/8 teaspoon per liter), or better yet, mineral-rich food ash from hardwood. Alternatively, boil distilled water briefly with a handful of crushed oyster shells, coral, or limestone, then filter. This adds calcium and other essential minerals without excessive salinity.</p><p>Adding minerals also improves taste by eliminating the flat flavor people associate with pure distilled water. A pinch of baking soda per liter achieves similar effect and adds sodium bicarbonate, supporting body pH balance.</p><h3>Proper Storage</h3><p>Store desalinated water in clean, covered containers away from direct sunlight. Use glass, ceramic, or food-grade plastic—never metal or chemically-treated containers. Keep lids tight to prevent dust and microbial contamination. In warm climates, store in the coolest available location and use stored water within days rather than weeks. Aged distilled water absorbs carbon dioxide from air and becomes slightly acidic; this is harmless but alters taste. For long-term storage, boil briefly before drinking to eliminate dissolved gases and any microbial growth.</p></section><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
