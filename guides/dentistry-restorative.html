Local anesthetic if available (2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine, infiltrate at base of lesion). If no anesthetic: accept patient discomfort, work quickly. Decay removal: mechanical excavation using dental bur (if handpiece available), or manual with dental chisel/scraper. Remove all caries (undermined enamel, discolored dentin). Cavity should feel hard when fully cleaned (soft dentin = remaining caries).</p><h3>Cavity Preparation Anatomy</h3><ul><li><strong>Outline form:</strong> Define cavity boundaries; walls should diverge toward occlusal (mechanical retention)<li><strong>Depth:</strong> Typically 1.5-2mm deep; avoid pulp exposure (pulp chamber ~0.5-1.5mm from surface depending on tooth)<li><strong>Walls:</strong> Smooth, slightly divergent (helps filling retention)<li><strong>Floor:</strong> Concave shape provides better retention<li><strong>Line angles:</strong> No sharp internal angles; slightly rounded to prevent restoration fracture</ul><h3>Pulp Exposure Consequences</h3><p>If drilling/excavation damages pulp (exposure visible as red bleeding spot): emergency treatment required. Options: temporary filling to seal (halt infection progression, allow pulp response), or extraction if infection already present/pulp necrotic. Some vital pulps recover with proper seal. Document exposure; monitor for abscess formation.</p></section><section id="filling-materials"><h2>Filling Materials</h2><h3>Amalgam (Silver Fillings)</h3><p>Composition: mercury + silver + copper + tin. Advantages: durable (20+ year lifespan), affordable, tolerate moisture, excellent retention. Disadvantages: not tooth-colored, requires more tooth removal for mechanical retention, mercury concerns (generally considered safe but use caution with exposure). Preparation: mix powder alloy with liquid mercury according to ratio (typically 1:1 or 5:8), condense into cavity with appropriate plugger. Allow setting (5-30 minutes depending on formulation). Shine/burnish outer surface.</p><h3>Composite Resin</h3><p>Plastic+resin material, tooth-colored. Advantages: aesthetic, bonds to tooth (less removal needed), no mercury. Disadvantages: less durable (5-10 years typical), more technique-sensitive, moisture-sensitive during placement (saliva contamination = bond failure). Requires: etchant (phosphoric acid to roughen enamel), adhesive, resin material, light source (usually UV/LED). Steps: etch enamel 15-20 seconds, rinse, dry; apply adhesive per product; apply composite; light-cure each layer. Difficult without proper equipment in field.</p><h3>Zinc Oxide Eugenol (Intermediate Restorative Material, IRM)</h3><p>Temporary material: powder (zinc oxide) + liquid (eugenol). Mix to putty consistency. Pack into cavity; carves easily once set (~24 hours). Adequate strength for temporary 6-12 months. Soluble in saliva (dissolves over time). In survival: adequate for temporary restoration. Limitations: not suitable for permanent restoration, stains, no adhesive bond.</p><h3>Glass Ionomer</h3><p>Powder (alumina silicate glass) + liquid (polyacrylic acid). Mix per instructions; placement windows short (~2-3 minutes). Sets chemically (no light needed, advantage in field). Releases fluoride (cavity prevention). Adequate strength for temporary, some permanent use in lower-stress areas. Advantages: moisture-tolerant, bonds to tooth. Disadvantages: less durable than amalgam/composite, technique-sensitive.</p></section><section id="temporary-restoration"><h2>Temporary Restoration</h2><h3>Indications for Temporary vs Permanent</h3><p><strong>Temporary:</strong> Survival scenario where permanent restoration delayed/impossible, tooth pain requiring seal (temporary relief pending extraction), decay arrested but not ready for definitive treatment. <strong>Permanent:</strong> If materials/expertise available, sufficient time, infection absent.</p><h3>Temporary Filling Placement</h3><ol><li>Prepare cavity (remove decay, shape as described)<li>Isolate tooth (cotton rolls, gauze to absorb saliva)<li>Select material (zinc oxide eugenol most practical in field)<li>Mix per product instructions<li>Pack into cavity using condensation instrument; fill completely to level of adjacent tooth<li>Smooth surface with finger/instrument (slightly proud to ease removal of excess)<li>Allow setting time per product (typically 5-30 min, check instructions)<li>Check bite: patient bites lightly; adjust if high<li>Provide patient instructions: avoid chewing on that tooth, report if sensitivity persists</ol><h3>Temporary Filling Stability</h3><p>Temporary materials less durable; expected to last weeks to months depending on material and location (posterior high-stress areas = shorter life). Patient instructions critical: avoid sticky foods, hard chewing. Monitor for: filling loss, recurring pain, margin breakdown. Plan definitive treatment; temporary is bridge, not solution.</p></section><section id="crowns"><h2>Crown and Bridge Work</h2><h3>Temporary Crown Fabrication</h3><p>After tooth preparation (usually for permanent crown): cover prepared tooth with temporary material to: protect tooth, maintain position, restore function, prevent decay. Field expedient: composite resin or acrylic temporary can be fabricated from impression. Steps: 1) Take alginate/impression material mold of unprepared tooth. 2) Prepare tooth as planned. 3) Use mold with temporary material to fabricate temporary crown. 4) Fit and adjust, cement with temporary cement. 5) Plan for permanent crown fabrication when possible.</p><h3>Permanent Crown Placement</h3><p>Gold, porcelain fused to metal (PFM), all-ceramic. Survival scenario: likely impossible to fabricate. Focus on: preservation of prepared tooth (temporary crown), prevention of further decay, extraction if restoration not feasible. If crown available: fit, adjust occlusion, cement with permanent cement (zinc phosphate, resin-modified glass ionomer, or adhesive resin).</p><h3>Re-cementing Loose Crowns</h3><p>Crown loose but still intact: clean cement from crown and tooth interior. Dry thoroughly. Re-cement: apply fresh temporary or permanent cement (zinc phosphate: mix powder + liquid to creamy consistency; fill crown interior/tooth). Seat crown, excess bleeds out, wipe. Advise patient to avoid chewing until cement sets (24 hours ideal, at least 1 hour minimum). If permanent re-cementation: requires drying for 48+ hours before eating (permanent cement stronger).</p></section><section id="cement"><h2>Cement and Adhesive Systems</h2><h3>Zinc Phosphate Cement (Traditional)</h3><p>Powder (zinc oxide, phosphoric acid, other oxides) + liquid (phosphoric acid). Mixing: add powder to liquid in small increments, spatulate on cool glass plate (reduces setting time). Consistency: creamy for luting. Use: temporary and permanent crowns, bridges, orthodontic bands. Set time: 6-7 minutes. Adequate strength, acceptable for field use if no other options.</p><h3>Glass Ionomer Cement</h3><p>Powder + liquid (polyacrylic acid). Mix per product. Sets chemically without light. Fluoride release provides cariostatic effect. Good for: temporary/permanent cement, core buildup material. Less strength than zinc phosphate but bonds to tooth structure. Moisture-sensitive during setting; protect from saliva.</p><h3>Resin-Based Adhesives</h3><p>Etching: phosphoric acid 37-40% applied to enamel/dentin 15-30 seconds, then rinse. Priming: apply primer per product instructions (wets etched surface). Bonding: apply bonding resin, light-cure. Creates strong bond. Advantages: superior retention, bonds composite to tooth. Disadvantages: technique-sensitive, requires light source, moisture contamination fails bond. In field: limited practicality without proper equipment.</p></section><section id="extraction-prep"><h2>Pre-Extraction Preparation</h2><h3>When Extraction Indicated</h3><p>Severe decay unrepairable, abscess present, severe periodontal disease, extraction pre-planned before complications, patient preference in survival scenario (limited resources). Alternatives: temporary restoration to delay extraction, extraction-only approach if restoration impossible.</p><h3>Pre-Extraction Radiography</h3><p>X-ray (if available) shows: root morphology (help predict extraction difficulty), bone level (assess periodontal status), presence of periapical pathology (determines antibiotic need). In survival: radiography rarely available; proceed on clinical presentation.</p><h3>Anesthesia Administration</h3><p>Infiltration (anterior teeth, buccal aspect): inject at apical level, deposit anesthetic. Nerve block (posterior/difficult cases): target specific nerve (inferior alveolar, mental, buccal) for complete numbing. Without anesthesia: accept patient pain, work quickly, consider emergency sedation/pain relief. Topical anesthetic (20% benzocaine) reduces injection discomfort.</p></section><section id="post-operative"><h2>Post-operative Care</h2><h3>Restoration Sensitivity</h3><p>New restoration may cause transient sensitivity (thermal, pressure) due to: microleakage at restoration margin, recurrent decay, residual pulpal inflammation. Management: NSAIDs, avoid triggering foods/temperatures, time (usually resolves in weeks). If sensitivity persists >2-4 weeks: consider restoration failure, leakage, or new decay; may require replacement.</p><h3>Restoration Failure</h3><p>Signs: margin breakdown, color change, restoration loss, recurring pain. Causes: marginal leakage (secondary decay), inadequate adaptation, material degradation, excessive chewing force. Management: assess damage, replace if loss >1/3 of restoration. If incomplete loss: might polish/refine without full replacement (depends on damage extent).</p><h3>Longevity Expectations</h3><table><tr><th scope="row">Material<th scope="row">Location<th scope="row">Expected Lifespan<tr><td>Amalgam<td>Posterior<td>20+ years<tr><td>Composite<td>Anterior<td>5-7 years<tr><td>Composite<td>Posterior<td>3-5 years<tr><td>Glass ionomer<td>Temporary<td>6-12 months<tr><td>Zinc oxide eugenol<td>Temporary<td>3-6 months</table></section><section id="safety"><div class="warning"><h3>Critical Restorative Safety</h3><ul><li>Pulp exposure = immediate treatment needed. Seal exposure immediately with temporary material to halt infection progression. Monitor for abscess; extraction if pulp necrotic.<li>Infection present = antibiotics prerequisite before restoration. Infected tissue compromises restoration success. Allow infection treatment (drainage, antibiotic therapy) before restoration placement.<li>Undiagnosed periapical pathology = restoration over infection fails. Assess for periapical abscess (percussion pain, radiographic change if available). Drain/treat before restoration.<li>Moisture contamination = bond failure. Isolate tooth adequately; saliva contamination during placement dooms adhesive restorations.</ul></div></section><section id="mistakes"><div class="mistakes"><h3>Common Restorative Errors</h3><ul><li><strong>Incomplete decay removal:</strong> Residual caries under restoration = progression, abscess. Ensure all discolored/soft dentin removed.<li><strong>Overfilled restoration:</strong> Excessive material causes high bite, TMJ dysfunction. Adjust occlusion after placement.<li><strong>Marginal gaps:</strong> Microleakage through margins = secondary decay. Proper cavity shape/material adaptation critical.<li><strong>Wrong material selection:</strong> Zinc oxide eugenol not appropriate for high-stress posterior; will fracture. Choose material matching location demands.<li><strong>Inadequate isolation:</strong> Moisture contamination during placement = restoration failure. Isolate thoroughly.</ul></div></section><div class="related" role="navigation" aria-label='Related guides'><h3>Related Guides</h3><a href="anatomy-oral.html">Oral Anatomy</a> • <a href="infection-control.html">Infection Control</a> • <a href="medications.html">Essential Medications</a> • <a href="first-aid.html">First Aid</a></div><footer><p>Zero to Hero Survival Compendium — Offline Reference</p></footer></div></main><script src="../shared/theme-sync.js"></script><script src="js/shared.js"></script></body></html>
