Why Certification Matters (Preventing Harm from Incompetence)</h2><p>Without formal systems, people make claims about their knowledge. In critical fields, unverified claims can be deadly:</p><h3>Medical Consequences</h3><p>An unqualified person dispensing medication might cause death through drug interactions, allergic reactions, or overdose. A person claiming to know surgery but lacking knowledge could kill a patient. Without certification, communities can't distinguish between expert healers and dangerous imposters.</p><h3>Engineering & Construction Failures</h3><p>A building designed by someone lacking structural knowledge might collapse, injuring or killing people. Water systems designed by unqualified people cause disease outbreaks. Bridges built by incompetent engineers fail under load. Engineering certification prevents these catastrophes.</p><h3>Food Safety Disasters</h3><p>Improper food preservation causes botulism and other deadly illnesses. Without certification, people preserving food for the community might use methods that create poisonous conditions. Certification ensures food handlers follow proven protocols.</p><h3>Educational Impact</h3><p>Unqualified teachers perpetuate misinformation that harms the next generation. Students who learn incorrect science, math, or technical skills face lifelong disadvantages. Teaching certification ensures educational quality.</p><h3>Trust in Critical Roles</h3><p>People need to trust their medical practitioners, engineers, and food handlers. Without formal certification, trust relies on reputation alone—which can be fraudulent. Certification provides objective verification.</p><div class="tip"> Certification is not elitist gatekeeping—it's protection from harm. It ensures people performing critical work have demonstrated competency. In collapse conditions where medical errors are often fatal, this protection is essential. </div></section><section id="medical-exams"><h2>3.
