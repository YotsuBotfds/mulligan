Analysis Date: February 15, 2026
Project: Zero to Hero Survival Compendium
Report Location: /sessions/sweet-great-darwin/mnt/survival-app/docs/TAXONOMY_REPORT.md

QUICK FACTS
================================================================================

Total Guides Analyzed:              261
Total Categories Found:             23 (across all sources)
Total Unique Tags:                  16
Categories with Proper Assignments: 15

KEY METRICS
================================================================================

Source: guides.json
  - 15 categories defined
  - 8 unique tags
  - 261 total guides
  - Category Coverage: 64 guides assigned (24.5%), 197 unassigned (75.5%)

Source: index.html
  - 8 compound data-tag values
  - Includes tags not in guides.json: "new", "technology"
  - Multiple tags combined into single string values

Source: skills_data.json & skills_merged.json
  - 8 categories (identical structure in both files)
  - Title Case naming convention
  - No tag information

Source: tools/ directory
  - 6 interactive tools
  - No categorization metadata found

CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Address)
================================================================================

ISSUE 1: Missing Categories [CRITICAL - IMPACT: HIGH]
  What: 197 guides (75.5%) have empty category field
  Where: guides.json "category" field is blank string
  Why: Incomplete data entry or schema mismatch
  Fix: Assign all guides to appropriate categories using new taxonomy
  Effort: 12-16 hours
  
ISSUE 2: Compound Tags in HTML [HIGH - IMPACT: MEDIUM]
  What: Data-tags are comma-separated strings instead of arrays
  Examples: "rebuild, new", "critical, medical, new"
  Problem: Cannot filter by individual tags in HTML
  Fix: Change to JSON array format: ["rebuild", "new"]
  Effort: 4-8 hours (code updates + testing)
  
ISSUE 3: Multiple Category Systems [HIGH - IMPACT: MEDIUM]
  What: guides.json and skills*.json use different category names
  Conflict: "metalworking" vs "Metallurgy", "power-generation" vs "Energy & Power"
  Problem: Unclear which is source of truth
  Fix: Consolidate to single taxonomy, map others to it
  Effort: 4-6 hours (analysis + mapping + update)

MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES
================================================================================

ISSUE 4: Undocumented Tag Expansion
  Tags in HTML but not guides.json: "new", "technology"
  Suggests automatic transformation during HTML generation
  Fix: Document the transformation process
  
ISSUE 5: Naming Inconsistencies
  Mixed conventions: kebab-case, lowercase, Title Case
  Examples: zth-modules, agriculture, Manufacturing
  Fix: Standardize to UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE for consistency
  
ISSUE 6: Orphaned Tool Data
  Category "tools" contains file paths instead of guide IDs
  Fix: Create proper tools-manifest.json or restructure
  
ISSUE 7: Single-Use Tags
  "human new" appears only once
  Suggests experimental/incomplete tagging
  Fix: Review and remove orphaned tags

TAG BREAKDOWN BY FREQUENCY
================================================================================

High Priority Tags (>20 uses):
  rebuild:    75 guides (28.7%) - Civilization rebuilding scenarios
  essential:  50 guides (19.1%) - Core survival fundamentals
  practical:  40 guides (15.3%) - Immediately actionable
  critical:   39 guides (14.9%) - Life-or-death knowledge
  start-here: 22 guides (8.4%)  - Entry point (zth-modules only)
  important:  22 guides (8.4%)  - Should know, valuable

Medium Priority Tags (5-20 uses):
  human:      7 guides  (2.7%)  - Human factors, culture

Low Priority Tags (<5 uses):
  tools:      6 guides  (2.3%)  - Interactive utilities
  new:        76+ (HTML only)   - Recently added content
  technology: 5 (HTML only)     - Technical/specialized content

PROPOSED SOLUTION: UNIFIED TAXONOMY
================================================================================

7 Primary Domain Categories:
  1. SURVIVAL_BASICS         - Immediate, life-critical skills
  2. FOOD_SYSTEMS            - Production and preservation
  3. CRAFTS_PRODUCTION       - Material transformation and tools
  4. ADVANCED_SYSTEMS        - Technology and infrastructure
  5. FOUNDATIONAL_KNOWLEDGE  - Science and understanding
  6. SOCIETY_CULTURE         - Human and community aspects
  7. TOOLS_UTILITIES         - Interactive and reference materials

5-Tier Tag System:
  Tier 1 - Priority:  CRITICAL, ESSENTIAL, IMPORTANT, PRACTICAL
  Tier 2 - Context:   IMMEDIATE, REBUILD, ADVANCED
  Tier 3 - Quality:   COMPLETE, DRAFT, REFERENCE
  Tier 4 - Status:    NEW, UPDATED, STABLE
  Tier 5 - Type:      INTERACTIVE, REFERENCE, TUTORIAL, ADVANCED

IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
================================================================================

PHASE 1 (Immediate - Week 1): Data Quality
  [ ] Assign categories to all 197 guides
  [ ] Normalize category names to UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE
  [ ] Validate all assignments
  [ ] Estimated: 12-16 hours

PHASE 2 (Short-term - Week 2-3): Standardization
  [ ] Fix HTML data-tags format (strings -> arrays)
  [ ] Update JavaScript filtering logic
  [ ] Reconcile skills*.json with guides.json
  [ ] Document tag semantics
  [ ] Estimated: 8-12 hours

PHASE 3 (Medium-term - Month 1): Documentation & Tools
  [ ] Create TAXONOMY.md specification
  [ ] Add JSON schema validation
  [ ] Implement pre-commit hooks
  [ ] Create quality dashboard
  [ ] Estimated: 12-20 hours

Total Effort: 32-48 hours of implementation

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (Next Week):
  1. Review TAXONOMY_REPORT.md with team
  2. Approve proposed unified taxonomy structure
  3. Begin category assignment for empty guides
  4. Schedule HTML/JavaScript refactoring

SHORT-TERM (Next 2-3 Weeks):
  1. Implement all Phase 1 and 2 changes
  2. Create mapping document between old and new taxonomies
  3. Test filtering and search functionality
  4. Update any integrations or external tools

LONG-TERM (Next Month):
  1. Implement validation systems
  2. Create comprehensive taxonomy documentation
  3. Establish content quality standards
  4. Monitor ongoing compliance with taxonomy
