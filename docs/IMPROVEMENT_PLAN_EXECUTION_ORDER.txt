ZERO TO HERO SURVIVAL COMPENDIUM - EXECUTION-ORDER IMPROVEMENT PLAN
=====================================================================

Current State Summary:
- 260+ HTML guides (~21 MB), 6 interactive tools (748 KB), 5 JSON data files (668 KB)
- Vanilla JS PWA with service worker, localStorage state, no dependencies
- index.html has 188 hardcoded guide cards (out of sync with 260+ actual guides)
- CSS minified to 19 lines (11.5 KB), app.js is 461 lines (18.7 KB)
- build.sh handles cache generation and validation
- Spreadsheets directory (312 KB, 9 xlsx files) exists but is not integrated

Parallelization key:
  [PARALLEL] = can run simultaneously with other [PARALLEL] items in the same phase
  [DEPENDS: X] = must wait for task X to finish
  [AGENT] = good candidate for a dedicated agent/subprocess


======================================================================
PHASE 0: CLEANUP & PROJECT SCAFFOLDING (30 minutes)
======================================================================
Everything here is independent. Launch all as parallel agents.

0.1 [PARALLEL] [AGENT: cleanup] Delete .DS_Store, add .gitignore

     - Would cut guide storage by 50-70%
     - Migration script for bulk conversion
     - Keep HTML rendering as fallback

10.7 [AGENT: contributor-docs] Create comprehensive contributor documentation
     - CONTRIBUTING.md with code style guide
     - docs/ARCHITECTURE.md with diagrams (data flow, component relationships)
     - docs/GUIDE_AUTHORING.md for content contributors
     - API documentation for all public JS functions
     - Add inline code comments for complex logic


======================================================================
AGENT PARALLELIZATION STRATEGY
======================================================================

The phases above are designed for maximum parallel execution within
each phase. Here is how to use multiple agents to compress the timeline:

PHASE 0 (30 min): 5 agents in parallel -> done in ~10 min
  Agent A: cleanup (.DS_Store, .gitignore)
  Agent B: scaffold (package.json)
  Agent C: docs (README.md)
  Agent D: favicon (icon generation)
  Agent E: docs-cleanup (consolidate existing docs, CHANGELOG)

PHASE 1 (1-2 hr): 5 agents in parallel -> done in ~30 min
  Agent A: data file audit and consolidation
  Agent B: guide count reconciliation
  Agent C: guide HTML structure audit
  Agent D: taxonomy reconciliation
  Agent E: spreadsheet audit

PHASE 2 (1 day): 5 agents in parallel -> done in ~3-4 hours
  Agent A: unminify CSS + extend variables
  Agent B: split app.js into modules + JSDoc
  Agent C: dynamic card rendering from guides.json
  Agent D: service worker rewrite
  Agent E: storage abstraction layer

PHASE 3 (half day): 5 agents in parallel -> done in ~2 hours
  Agent A: build system modernization
  Agent B: dev server setup
  Agent C: linting + formatting + pre-commit hooks
  Agent D: test framework + initial tests
  Agent E: guide scaffolding script

PHASE 4 (1 day): 10 agents in parallel -> done in ~2-3 hours
  Agents A-J: each UX feature is fully independent
  (offline indicator, search, reading time, difficulty, recently viewed,
   progress viz, theme sync, print styles, tools nav, share)

PHASE 5 (1-2 days): 7 agents in parallel -> done in ~4-6 hours
  BUT has internal dependencies (template before cleanup, taxonomy before metadata)
  Sub-wave 1: template (5.1) + taxonomy finalization
  Sub-wave 2: CSS cleanup (5.2), metadata (5.3), prerequisites (5.4), spreadsheet integration (5.7)
  Sub-wave 3: learning paths (5.5), table of contents (5.6)

PHASE 6 (1 day): 9 agents in parallel -> done in ~2-3 hours
  All accessibility and security tasks are independent
  Can run fully parallel with late Phase 5 work

PHASE 7 (1-2 days): 6 agents in parallel -> done in ~4-6 hours
  All optimization tasks are independent once architecture is stable

PHASE 8 (2-3 days): 10 agents in parallel -> done in ~6-8 hours
  All features are independent of each other

PHASE 9 (half day): 4 agents in parallel -> done in ~1-2 hours
  CI/CD, error tracking, analytics, env config all independent

PHASE 10 (ongoing): sequential dependencies limit parallelism
  TypeScript and IndexedDB can run in parallel
  Cloud sync depends on IndexedDB
  Quiz depends on metadata
  Community depends on cloud sync


TOTAL ESTIMATED WALL-CLOCK TIME:
  Serial execution:       ~2-3 weeks
  With 5 parallel agents: ~4-5 days
  With 10 parallel agents: ~2-3 days

The biggest time savings come from:
  - Phase 4 (10 independent UX features)
  - Phase 5 (bulk operations across 260+ guide files)
  - Phase 6 (9 independent accessibility/security tasks)
  - Phase 8 (10 independent advanced features)

Critical path (longest dependency chain):
  Phase 0 -> Phase 1 (guide audit) -> Phase 2 (dynamic cards + modules)
  -> Phase 3 (build system) -> Phase 5 (metadata + learning paths)
  -> Phase 7 (search index) -> Phase 8 (scenario planner, glossary)
  This chain is ~24-30 hours of actual work, compressible to ~12-15 hours
  with agents handling the non-critical-path items in parallel.
